  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">PREFACE.</span></p>

  <p>The great increase in our knowledge of animals which has taken place since the volume on
  Monkeys was published in "Jardine's Naturalist's Library" some sixty years ago, cannot be better
  illustrated than by the fact that our excellent contributor, Dr. H. O. Forbes, has found it
  impossible to compress that knowledge into a single volume of the present issue. There is,
  moreover, no Museum which contains such a complete series of skins of the Primates, as to render a
  perfect "monograph" of the Order possible. Dr. Forbes has endeavoured in these volumes to bring
  the subject up to date, and has devoted some years of study to the two which now appear under his
  name, and he has had the great advantage of having seen many of the species of which these volumes
  treat, in a state of nature. If diligent research and patient work, combined with a sound
  anatomical knowledge and an acquaintance with many species of Monkeys in their natural habitat,
  avail anything, then these volumes should present to the student a more concise epitome of the
  characteristics of the Primates than any other essay yet offered to the public. It has been found
  impossible to reproduce any of the plates in the old "Naturalist's Library" of Jardine. They would
  have formed, with appropriate inscriptions, a very good instalment of a series of "Comic Natural
  History" volumes, as they were, in fact, <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi">{vi}</span>nothing but
  a set of extraordinary caricatures of Monkeys. I have, therefore, again to acknowledge the
  liberality of the publishers, in adopting my suggestion that a perfectly new set of illustrations
  should be prepared. These have been executed by Mr. J. G. Keulemans, with a result, I hope, that
  will satisfy the reader.</p>

  <p class="sp5 ar" style="margin-right:2em">R. BOWDLER SHARPE.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagevii">{vii}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">INTRODUCTION.</span></p>

  <p>In the first volume will be found an account of the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, and the
  <i>Anthropoidea</i> as far as the group of the Macaques of the family <i>Cercopithecidæ</i>. The
  second volume continues with the latter genus, and contains the rest of the Monkeys, and the Apes,
  as well as a summary of the geographical distribution of the species of the Order Primates.</p>

  <p>I have not attempted to write a complete synonymy of the species of Monkeys. The literature is
  scattered over many, often obscure, periodicals, and without seeing the actual specimens described
  by some of the older writers, it would be easy to introduce a great deal of confusion into the
  synonymy. I have, therefore, only attempted to give the principal references.</p>

  <p>I must express my obligation to Dr. Günther, F.R.S., the Keeper of the Zoological Department in
  the British Museum, for the facilities of study afforded to me in that institution. To Mr.
  Oldfield Thomas I am likewise greatly indebted for much assistance, and for many a kindly
  hint.</p>

  <p>Dr. Forsyth Major, who is well-known as one of the foremost authorities on the Lemurs, not only
  gave me valuable information as to the species and literature of the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, but was
  even so good as to furnish me with the descriptions of several new species.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pageviii">{viii}</span></div>

  <p>Lastly, to my friend the Editor, I have to return my sincere thanks for the patience with which
  he has revised my MSS., and for the verification of numbers of references, only to be found in the
  great libraries of London, and inaccessible to an author dwelling in the provinces.</p>

  <p>Of the varied forms of animal life that people the globe, those that possess a back-bone and
  two pairs of limbs (the <span class="sc">Vertebrata</span>) are considered the highest in the
  scale. Of the <i>Vertebrata</i>, those are held to be of superior organisation which possess warm
  red blood and suckle their young with milk from the breast (<i>i.e.</i>, <span
  class="sc">Mammalia</span>). Our present volume deals with the highest and most specialised group
  of the Mammalia, and, therefore, of the whole Animal Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Man, in respect of his mental endowments, stands alone and unapproachable among living
  creatures. Considered as to his "place in nature," however, he must be described as an
  erect-walking Mammal, possessing anterior extremities developed into hands of great perfection,
  for exclusive use as tactile and grasping organs, and posterior limbs, on which his body is
  perfectly balanced and entirely supported, exclusively devoted to locomotion, as well as highly
  specialised cerebral characters. These attributes in part constitute the standard by which we
  estimate superiority in animal structure, and fitness of adaptation.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the numerous varieties and races of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page2">{2}</span>mankind distributed over every region of the globe, each exhibiting
  differences in habits, customs and superficial complexion, Man forms but one species, <i>Homo
  sapiens</i>, the sole representative of the unique genus of his family. Though the genus
  <i>Homo</i> is thus far apparently zoologically isolated, there is a remarkable group of animals,
  which we designate "Apes," and which, possessing many of the same structural characters more or
  less modified, stand apart from all the other Mammalia, and make a distinct approach to Man.
  Between Man, however, and the Apes, even the untrained eye at once perceives, amid obvious marks
  of inferiority, unmistakable resemblances, while anatomical investigations reveal that "the points
  in which Man differs from the Apes most nearly resembling him, are not of greater importance than
  those in which the Ape differs from other and universally acknowledged members of the group."
  (<i>Flower</i> and <i>Lydekker</i>.) The Apes, on the other hand, are so nearly related to the
  Monkeys, the Baboons and the Marmosets, by characters which insensibly merge into each other that
  they, along with Man, must logically be embraced in the same zoological division. The animals
  known to us as Lemurs, called by the Germans "Half-Apes" and by the French "False-Monkeys," are
  the nearest to the Apes and Man of all the remaining Mammals, though there are many points of
  divergence from the above-named groups. The Lemurs, in fact, exhibit considerable affinity to
  lower forms of Mammalia, especially to the Insectivora, but in internal structure and habit they
  approach the Anthropiform<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> group just referred
  to&mdash;in the flattened form of the digits, the opposable great toe, with its ankle-bone (the
  ento-cuneiform) rounded for its articulation, as in the higher Apes and Man.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page3">{3}</span></div>

  <p>The Lemurs have, by many distinguished naturalists, been relegated to a distinct Order quite
  separate from the latter; but by such pre-eminent authorities as Linnæus, Lesson, Huxley, Broca
  and Flower, they have been assigned a subordinate position within that great Order, on which has
  been conferred the rank of the Primates of the Animal Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The Order <span class="sc">Primates</span>, therefore, comprises two very homogeneous
  sub-orders&mdash;(1) The Lemur-like animals (<span class="sc">Lemuroidea</span>) including the
  Aye-Aye, the Tarsier, and the True Lemurs; and (2) the Man-like animals (the <span
  class="sc">Anthropoidea</span>), which embrace the Marmosets, the Baboons, the great Apes, and
  Man.</p>

  <p>In common with all other Mammals, the Primates are furnished with an epidermal covering, which,
  except in Man, consists of a woolly or hairy fur. They possess four limbs and a tail, which may be
  long, short, or concealed, and which is often used as a prehensile organ. The young are born in a
  condition of greater or less helplessness, with their eyes, as a rule, unopened, and the framework
  of their bodies incompletely ossified, and consequently requiring protective care and entire
  nourishment from the mother, for a considerable period. At maturity this skeleton consists of a
  skull, a breast- and a back-bone of many pieces, ribs, jointed limbs, and a pair of collar-bones.
  As a knowledge of many of these bones and some of the more prominent organs of the body are
  necessary for an accurate comprehension of the description and classification of the animals
  discussed in this volume, a few of the more important must be briefly referred to.</p>

  <p>The <i>cranium</i>, formed of many bones firmly united together, consists of a cerebral region,
  or box, containing and guarding the brain, and a facial region, in which are situated, besides the
  mouth, the organs of sight and smell. The bones connected with the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page4">{4}</span>mouth are the two maxillæ, along the margins of which are placed the
  grinding- or cheek-teeth; the two pre-maxillæ, in which are set the cutting- and the eye-teeth;
  and lastly, the palatine bones which form the roof of the mouth. Hinged on to the sides of the
  cranium is the toothed mandible, or lower jaw, composed of two halves, which may be solidly or
  loosely joined together in the mid-line, or symphysis. Along the under surface of the skull, there
  are, besides the great (often posterior) orifice for the entrance of the spinal cord, numerous
  <i>foramina</i>, or openings, for the passage of blood-vessels for the nourishment of the brain,
  and of nerves which bring all parts of the body into relation with the supreme directing centre.
  Conspicuous near its posterior part, on each side, is an ivory-like capsule, the periotic bone,
  containing the essential organ of hearing. Lying beneath the lower jaw is the hyoid arch, a
  slender framework of bones, supporting the tongue and the upper end of the windpipe with the organ
  of voice. In a few of the Monkeys and Apes certain of the bones of this arch are much enlarged and
  hollowed for increasing the volume of sound emitted by them. On either side of the great opening
  which is so conspicuous at the hinder part of the skull, for the reception of the spinal cord, is
  a smooth kidney-shaped surface, called a "condyle." These two condyles serve for the articulation
  of the first segment of the back-bone to the cranium, and by the possession of this pair of
  condyles the Mammalian skull can always be distinguished from that of Birds and Reptiles. The
  pieces of which the back-bone are composed are named the <i>vertebræ</i>. Those of the neck, the
  "cervical" vertebræ, are recognised by having no true ribs attached to them, and are, in all
  Primates, seven in number. Those of the back, or "dorsal" vertebræ, may be distinguished by having
  articulated to them, on each side, <span class="pagenum" id="page5">{5}</span>a movable rib, the
  other end of which is attached to the breast-bone; they follow next to the cervical vertebræ,
  while to them succeed the "lumbar" vertebræ which carry no complete ribs. The dorsal and lumbar
  segments vary in number, but together they rarely exceed seventeen. Behind these extend the
  "sacral" vertebræ&mdash;completely ossified together, and lastly, the bones of the tail or
  "caudal" vertebræ, which may be many or few, according to the length of that appendage.</p>

  <p>The fore-limb is composed of three segments, the arm, fore-arm, and hand, together with a block
  by which it is attached to the side of the body. To this block&mdash;the blade-bone or
  <i>scapula</i>&mdash;is articulated the arm-bone, or <i>humerus</i>, which at its elbow-joint
  hinges with the two bones, the <i>ulna</i> and the <i>radius</i>, of the fore-arm, on which in
  turn the hand is rotated. The hand is made up of three parts, the wrist-bones, or <i>carpus</i>,
  closely united together in two transverse rows with a central bone intervening between them; next
  the elongated bones of the palm of the hand, or <i>metacarpus</i>, one to each finger, and lastly
  the <i>phalanges</i>, or finger-bones, three to each digit, except in the thumb, where there are
  but two. The hind-limb is formed on exactly the same plan. It has a connecting block&mdash;the
  pelvis; giving suspension to the thigh, with its single bone, the <i>femur</i>, to which
  articulates the leg, with two bones (<i>tibia</i> and <i>fibula</i>), and the tripartite foot,
  composed of <i>tarsus</i>, <i>metatarsus</i>, and <i>phalanges</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the digestive organs of the Primates the teeth present very important characters, from the
  point of view of the classification of the Order. They differ in form and number, and have
  distinct functions to perform. The teeth situated in front are the <i>incisors</i> and
  <i>canines</i>, sharp and pointed, for seizing, cutting, and holding the food. Behind them come
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span><i>pre-molars</i>, and still further back the
  <i>molars</i>, both with broad crowns of complicated tubercles and ridges for milling the hard
  portions contained in the food. Animals provided&mdash;as all the Primates are&mdash;with these
  different sorts of teeth, are said to be <i>Heterodont</i>,<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> in contradistinction to forms like the Dolphins and Whales, which
  are termed <i>Homodont</i>,<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> because the whole of
  these teeth are of the same pattern. The Primates are <i>Diphyodont</i><a id="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> as well, because many of their permanent teeth are preceded by
  another set, commonly known as the <i>milk-teeth</i>. In order to present to the eye at a glance
  the number of each sort that any species possesses, a <i>dental formula</i> has been adopted by
  naturalists. Such a formula as I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span
  class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">1</span><span
  class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span> = 36, indicates that in <i>one half of the mouth</i>, above and
  below, there are 2 incisors, 1 canine, 3 pre-molars, and 3 molars = 18; and therefore in the
  <i>two halves</i> of the mouth together there are 36 teeth in all.</p>

  <p>The masticated food, partially digested by the saliva of the mouth, descends the gullet by the
  muscular contractions of its walls to the simple, sac-like, stomach, and thence to the intestines.
  These latter consist of two portions, one smaller and narrower, nearer to the stomach, and a
  second portion further down, larger and wider; the junction of the two portions being marked by a
  process of varying length, the <i>cæcum</i>. The stomach and intestines, with other important
  structures, such as the liver, kidneys and generative organs, are contained in a lower cavity,
  separated by a muscular midriff, the diaphragm, from the upper part or thorax, containing the
  blood-purifying and pumping organs, the lungs and the heart.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span></div>

  <p>The upper part of the windpipe is, in all Primates, modified to form the larynx, or organ of
  voice, constituted by fibrous strings stretched across its orifice, where they may be set in
  vibration by the air, in its passage to and from the lungs.</p>

  <p>The brain is relatively large in proportion to the body, and attains in the higher of the two
  sub-orders its most perfect development. The main brain (or cerebral hemispheres), when viewed
  from above, in size preponderates over, and conceals (except in the Lemurs) all the other parts of
  that organ. The surface of its lateral halves, which are connected by transverse bands so as to
  insure harmony of action between them, is marked by fissures and foldings, or convolutions, which
  vary in number and complexity, evidently in relation to the intelligence of the animal. The brain
  within the skull gives origin to the nerves for the chief organs of sense; while from its
  posterior part it is continued along the back&mdash;within a canal formed by the neural arches of
  the vertebræ&mdash;as the spinal column, from which arise the rest of the nerves for the body.</p>

  <p>The young of all the Primates are nourished in the mother's womb by the passage of material
  from the blood-vessels of the parent through an organ known as the <i>placenta</i>. They are all
  born in a helpless condition, and remain unable to look after themselves for a considerable
  period, during which they are dependent on the milk secreted on the ventral surface of the mother
  by two or four glands, the teats or <i>mammæ</i>&mdash;those characteristic organs from which the
  "Mammalia" have derived their name. These glands are present in both sexes, but are functional
  only in the female.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We shall now proceed to describe more minutely the first of the two sub-orders of
  the Primates&mdash;the Lemur-like animals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>I. THE LEMURS&mdash;SUB-ORDER LEMUROIDEA.</b></p>

  <p>The Aye-Aye, the Tarsier, and the True Lemurs constitute this first sub-order. They are
  characterised by having the muzzle long and narrow, more or less Dog-like in shape, and the upper
  lip often divided into two by the nose-pad. The external ears (Fig. 1) are enlarged, with
  flattened margins, but have no "hem" as in the higher Anthropoids. (Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The trunk is relatively long and compressed, and the tail when long is never truly prehensile.
  Of the limbs, the posterior are longer than the anterior, and all have five digits, each bearing a
  flat nail except the second toe, which has invariably a long pointed claw, their tips ending in
  prominent discoidal tactile pads. (Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>Of the digits, the index is sometimes quite rudimentary, while the thumb is large, and the
  great toe especially so, both being opposable. Teats occur on the breast, on the abdomen, or on
  both.</p>

  <p>Of the skeleton, the eye-sockets, or orbits, are directed forward, and have complete bony
  margins, which, however, are not <span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>closed in by bone
  behind (as in Monkeys), but freely communicating beneath the post-orbital process (except in
  <i>Tarsius</i>) with the temporal hollow behind. In the young of some species the orbit is more
  enclosed than it is in the adult: the orifice for the lachrymal duct of the eye is placed external
  to the margin of the orbit: the hollow for the olfactory lobes of the brain is always large.</p>

  <p>Having four kinds of teeth, and a set in succession to the milk-teeth, they are Heterodont and
  Diphyodont. The dental formula is I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span

  class="ifracd">3</span></span> = 36 (<i>vide</i> anteà, p. <a href="#page6">6</a>), and the upper
  jaw has a toothless space in the centre (except in the Aye-Aye). Of the upper teeth, the
  <i>incisors</i> are sometimes absent, but generally present; if unequal in size the inner one is
  the larger of the two. The canines are prominent; the pre-molars all have a <i>cingulum</i>, or
  girdle, round the base, more or less enlarged backwards into a process ("talon" or "heel"); the
  anterior pre-molar vertically long and canine-shaped; the median and posterior with three main
  points (tubercles or cusps) and one or two smaller ones on the crown, and having a bar or ridge
  uniting the front inner with the hind outer cusp. The anterior and median <i>molars</i> have three
  or four main cusps, and one <span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span>or two smaller or
  subsidiary ones on the crown; the cingulum is well developed. The posterior molars have generally
  three cusps.</p>

  <p>In the lower jaw the <i>incisors</i> are close-set and comb-like, remarkable for protruding in
  front, like the teeth of a Rat or a Rabbit. The <i>canines</i> also protrude horizontally, and,
  being placed alongside of the incisors, are difficult to distinguish from the latter excepting
  that they are broader and thicker.</p>

  <p>Of the <i>pre-molars</i> the anterior are canine-shaped, the median and posterior ones have
  three main, and one or two subordinate, cusps on the crowns. In both the upper and lower
  <i>molars</i>, cross-bridges stretch between the outer and inner front cusps as well as between
  the outer and inner hind cusps. <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>There is an oblique
  ridge between the hind outer and the front inner cusp, and another is often present between the
  front outer cusp and the anterior "heel," producing, as Huxley has pointed out, almost a double
  crescentic pattern, as in many lower Mammals. The posterior molar has four or five cusps.</p>

  <p>Of the <i>milk-teeth</i>, the incisors in the upper jaw change first. Of the molars, two are
  developed before the change of the pre-molars. In the lower jaw the incisors change first, and
  when two or three pre-molars have developed the last molar has still to come.</p>

  <p>The arm-bone, or <i>humerus</i>, has one perforation (<i>entepicondylar foramen</i>) on its
  inner margin, and another above the joint (except in <i>Perodicticus</i>). The bones of the
  fore-arm (<i>radius</i> and <i>ulna</i>), and those of the leg (<i>tibia</i> and <i>fibula</i>)
  are not co-ossified (except in <i>Tarsius</i>), so that the palm or sole can be turned up at
  will.</p>

  <p>The bones of the <i>digits</i> are more or less flat and rounded at the tips (differing in this
  respect from the <i>Insectivora</i>). One of the ankle-bones, for the articulation of the
  opposable great toe, the ento-cuneiform, as it is called, is rounded, as in the Anthropoid Apes
  and Man. The thumb is opposable, but its articulating bone in the wrist is not rounded, except in
  <i>Avahis</i> and <i>Indris</i>, which genera agree in this respect with <i>Anthropopithecus</i>
  and Man. The wrist has its central bone (<i>os centrale</i>) present; it is absent in Man and the
  higher Apes.</p>

  <p>The knee is free and not united to the side of the body by integument.</p>

  <p>The two halves of the lower jaw are not always co-ossified (as is the case in the
  <i>Anthropoidea</i>).</p>

  <p>The opening in the base of the skull (the <i>foramen rotundum</i>) which transmits from the
  brain a branch of the fifth nerve <span class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span>for the upper jaw,
  and the sphenoidal fissure, which gives exit to the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves, have
  but one aperture, as in the Rabbit, which belongs to the <i>Rodentia</i>.</p>

  <p>The sacral vertebræ are generally three in number, and the lumbar and dorsal together vary from
  nineteen to twenty-three.</p>

  <p>The brain, as Sir William Flower has observed, departs considerably from the form of what may
  be called the primatial type, and approaches in form to that of the carnivorous animals. The
  hind-brain, or <i>cerebellum</i>, is not completely covered by the cerebrum. The latter has but
  few convolutions (indicating a low intelligence), but its posterior lobe is always present, though
  more or less rudimentary, and so also are many fissures, which are characteristic of its surface
  in the higher Primates. The olfactory lobes are usually large and not covered by the cerebrum.</p>

  <p>The uterus and structures for the nutrition of the young prior to birth are low in type, and
  approximate to the conditions seen in the Pig, the Horse, the Chevrotains, and the Ruminants. The
  unborn Lemur is often encased (as among the Sloths) in a skin-like covering (<i>epitrichium</i>)
  which breaks into patches before birth.</p>

  <p>The tongue has a horny supplementary under-tongue (<i>sublingua</i>) attached beneath it. The
  stomach is simple, not formed of several compartments. The transverse portion of the great
  intestine is convoluted in a remarkable manner upon itself, the cæcum also being very large. The
  main arteries of the arm and leg break up (as in the Sloths) into an immense number of small
  vessels (called <i>retia mirabilia</i>) parallel to one another instead of being simple branching
  trunks.</p>

  <p>The long tendons of the muscles for flexing the digits (the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13">{13}</span><i>flexor longus digitorum</i>) differ generally in arrangement from those
  of the higher Primates.</p>

  <p>The Lemuroids are of no commercial value to Man.</p>

  <p>As regards their distribution, the <i>Lemuroidea</i> are now absolutely confined to the Old
  World, and predominate in the island of Madagascar, where, as M. Grandidier remarks in his
  magnificent work on that country, there is scarcely a little wood in any district in which they
  are not found. Indeed, of the nearly seventy species of Mammals inhabiting that island,
  thirty-five, or one-half, are Lemurs. Members of the family also occur across the whole of the
  neighbouring continent of Africa, but their northern range does not reach quite to the tropic,
  whereas it extends some few degrees beyond it in the Southern Hemisphere. Elsewhere they are
  confined to the forests of the Oriental region. More or less isolated in Southern India, they
  re-appear in China, and spreading south to Java they reach as far east as Celebes and the
  Philippine Islands. The present isolation of the Lemurs in two such distant areas&mdash;in Africa
  and Madagascar and some of the Mascarene Islands on the one hand, and in Southern India, China,
  Ceylon, and the Malayan Islands on the other&mdash;has been considered by some naturalists as
  weighty evidence in favour of a former land connection between these distant regions.</p>

  <p>Though so restricted in their distribution at the present day, this group was more widely
  represented in past ages of the world's history, as we shall have to point out later on. Abundant
  fossil remains prove that they lived in Europe and in North America, where to-day they are quite
  unknown.</p>

  <p>The <i>Lemuroidea</i> are almost entirely arboreal, and seldom come to the ground, except the
  Sifakas, which then progress <span class="pagenum" id="page14">{14}</span>on their hind legs by a
  series of bounds, holding their hands over their head in a ludicrous fashion. Most of them are
  nocturnal, or crepuscular, sleeping the greater part of the day in holes or on a branch of a tree
  coiled up in a ball. Their food consists chiefly of leaves, fruits, honey, birds' eggs, and birds,
  or any small animals they can pounce upon.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The Lemurs now living are divided into three families. The Aye-Aye and the
  Tarsiers, on account of their very special characters, constitute each a distinct
  family&mdash;named <i>Chiromyidæ</i> and <i>Tarsiidæ</i> respectively&mdash;while the True Lemurs
  form the third, the <i>Lemuridæ</i>, to which all the remaining forms belong.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE AYE-AYES. FAMILY CHIROMYIDÆ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This very aberrant family contains only one species; the characters of the family
  and of the genus <i>Chiromys</i> are, therefore, necessarily those of the single species
  known.</p>

  having one incisor, no canine, and one pre-molar tooth on each side. Dorsal and lumbar vertebræ
  together 18, sacral 3, and caudal 22-27.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span></div>

  <p>Olfactory lobes of brain covered by the cerebrum; convolutions and grooves of cerebrum similar
  to those in normal Lemurs. Intestine 26 inches long; no striped tissue in the muscular sheath of
  the gullet at the anterior end of the stomach. Digastric muscle (for moving the jaws) very much
  developed in accordance with the great gnawing powers of the species.</p>

  <p>Fur on back, flanks, tail, and limbs dark brown, nearly black, but with the white of the basal
  half of the hairs shining through; hair woolly at base; long hairs on top of head and back of neck
  tipped with white; short hairs of face dirty white. Nose and lips naked, flesh-coloured; ears
  black; sides of head and throat greyish-yellow; chest often bright yellow, the chin paler. Inner
  sides of limbs yellowish-white, and on the under surface of the body the basal part of hairs
  showing through, producing a pale yellowish-white, or sub-rufous, colour. Feet and digits black.
  Tail black, at its base greyish-white or greyish-brown, and often with long white hairs
  throughout. The species is more nearly related to the members of the genus <i>Galago</i> to be
  described later on, than to any other of the <i>Lemuroidea</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Aye-Aye is confined to the island of Madagascar. It makes its
  home in the dense parts of the great forest that runs along the eastern border of its central
  plateau, but only in that part of it which separates the Sihànaka Province from that of the
  Betsimisàraka, which is about 25 miles from the east coast, in latitude 17° 22&prime; S. It is
  more common than has been supposed, its noctural habits and the superstitious awe with which it is
  regarded accounting for its apparent rarity, and for the contradictory reports given of its
  habits.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Aye-Aye, whose name is derived from its call of "hai-hay,"
  is one of the most singular of living animals. It was first discovered by Sonnerat during his
  travels in <span class="pagenum" id="page17">{17}</span>Madagascar in 1780, and by him sent to
  Paris. The skin remained unique in Europe for the best part of a century. Greatly owing to the
  superstitious dread in which the creature is held by the natives, it was for a long period, and is
  still, very difficult to procure, or to induce the natives to capture, specimens. Mr. Baron says
  that it is sometimes accidentally caught in traps by the natives, "but the owner of the trap,
  unless one of those versed in the Aye-Aye mysteries who know the charm by which to counteract its
  evil power, smears fat over it, thus securing its forgiveness and goodwill, and sets it free." In
  1863 Dr. Sandwith sent a second example to Europe, the anatomy of whose body was made the subject
  of an exhaustive monograph by the late Sir Richard Owen. Since that date more than one specimen
  has been received alive, and its habits and constitution are now fairly well known. The Aye-Aye is
  entirely arboreal and nocturnal, sleeping during the day, with its body coiled round, lying on its
  side with its bushy tail spread over it as a covering. It suspends itself by its hind-limbs, and
  in this position it has been observed in captivity by Mr. Bartlett, using its hook-like finger to
  comb out its tail, to cleanse its face, the corners of its eyes, its nose, mouth, and ears,
  keeping meanwhile its other fingers closed. It lives in the depths of the forests, going about in
  pairs. Exquisitely keen of hearing, it can detect by sound the boring of insects within the dead
  branches of trees. Its attenuated wire-like finger acts as a probe to discover their position, and
  its powerful incisor teeth are used to cut down upon the tunnel of its prey, which consists
  principally of the Andraitra, the larva of a Beetle, which it then extracts with the same digit.
  The juices of plants are also supposed to form part of its food. It drinks after the manner of
  many Monkeys, by dipping its fingers into the water, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page18">{18}</span>drawing them through its mouth. The Aye-Aye is fearless of Man, but in its
  wakeful hours, during the night, when irritated it can be very savage and strike out with its
  hands. The female produces but one young at a birth, and builds, in the fork of a tree, a
  ball-like nest, two feet in diameter, with an entrance hole in the side, forming it of the rolled
  up leaves of the Travellers'-tree, and lining it with small twigs and dry leaves.

  <p class="sp3 ac">THE TARSIERS. FAMILY TARSIIDÆ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This family, like the preceding, has been constituted for the reception of two
  animals which are so remarkably distinct from all the other species of Lemurs, as to necessitate
  their being thus segregated. Between these two forms however, so close a relationship exists, that
  they have often been considered as only varieties of the same species. The family, therefore,
  consists, as in the <i>Chiromyidæ</i>, of a single genus, the characters of which constitute also
  those of the family.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE TARSIERS. GENUS
  TARSIUS.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Tarsius</i>, Storr. Prod. Method. Mamm., p. 32 (1780).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Tarsiers are distinguished externally by the possession of a rounded head, and a very
  short, pointed muzzle; by their very large, long and naked ears, and eyes so remarkably large and
  protruding, as to form the most prominent feature of the face. The hind-limb, which is much longer
  than the fore-limb, is also very remarkable on account of the great elongation of the ankle-region
  (or tarsus) of the limb. The long and slender toes terminate in round, sucker-like discs, and are
  furnished with flat nails, except on the second and third toes, where the nails are merely
  compressed claws. The <span class="pagenum" id="page19">{19}</span>fore-limb, with or without the
  hand, is longer than the trunk; its digits also are long and slender (the third being longest, and
  the second equal to the fourth) and, like those of the foot, terminate in round sucker-like discs.
  Both the wrist and ankle are haired.</p>

  <p>The long and Rat-like tail is longer than the body, and has a tufted termination. The skull
  presents enormous eye-cavities, the inner margins of the latter almost meeting in the centre. The
  orbits are nearly closed in from the temporal fossa by the union of the malar and alisphenoid
  bones&mdash;a character in which they differ from all other Lemurs, and approach the Anthropoid
  section of the Primates. Their dental formula is I<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span> = 34. Of the upper jaw, the incisors
  are prominent and unequal, the anterior ones being larger than the posterior, and in contact in
  the middle line, thus leaving no central gap in the front of the jaw, as is the rule among Lemurs;
  the canines are about as long vertically as the inner incisor, and are smaller than the
  corresponding tooth in the True Lemurs; the pre-molars are canine-like, sharp, pointed, and
  furnished with a cingulum; the anterior pre-molar is smaller than the two others; the posterior
  pre-molar has one external and one internal cusp; the molars, all nearly equal in size, are wide
  transversely, strongly cingulate, and have two prominent external cusps. In the lower jaw, the
  solitary incisor in each half is small, and, instead of protruding horizontally, is nearly erect;
  the canines are also almost erect, and less like incisors than is usual in the Sub-order. The
  pre-molars are sharp, but the anterior is smaller than the two posterior; the anterior and median
  molars have four cusps, and are cingulate, while the posterior molar has five cusps.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page20">{20}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The Tarsiers have nineteen dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together, and twenty-seven in
  the tail. The humerus presents a perforation (the entepicondylar foramen) at its lower inner side,
  and another nearly in the centre above the hinge. The femur is more than twice the length of the
  arm-bone; the lower half of the slender fibula is co-ossified with the tibia, while two of the
  tarsal, or ankle-bones (the <i>calcaneum</i> and <i>naviculare</i>), are remarkably elongated,
  thus giving to the hind-limb of these animals the singular conformation from which they derive
  their name. The large intestine is not convoluted upon itself as in so many of the Lemurs, nor is
  there a cæcum at the junction of its smaller and larger portions.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Closely related to the preceding species in size and other characters,
  but distinguished by the colour of the hands, which are dark brown.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Inhabits the islands of the Indian Archipelago, farther to the
  eastward than those in which <i>Tarsius Tarsius</i> is found. It has been recorded from Celebes,
  and the neighbouring groups of Salayer and Sanghir, and from some of the Philippine Islands, such
  as Bohol and Mindanao.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The habits of both species of Tarsier are identical, and may be described
  together. They are almost entirely nocturnal and arboreal animals, rarely, of their own accord,
  coming to the ground. They move from place to place by leaping along the larger branches, or from
  tree to tree, even when these stand several feet distant. When they do descend, however, they
  advance on the ground by the same curious Frog-like leaps, without bringing their fore-limbs down
  to the ground. The Tarsier is said to climb easily, even without grasping, by means of the round
  discs on its slender finger-tips, which, like suckers, enable it to hold on by the side pressure
  of its limbs to any smooth surface, such as the stems of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page22">{22}</span>bamboo-brakes which it frequents. Mr. Charles Hose, in his "Mammals of
  Borneo," states that, in that island, the Tarsier is found in the jungles of the low country,
  skipping about from branch to branch. According to the notes of this excellent field-naturalist,
  it has a habit of turning its head almost completely round without moving the rest of its body.
  This very remarkable creature lives in pairs in the tropical forests, in holes in the tree stems,
  or under their roots, feeding chiefly on insects and small lizards, which, as Mr. Cuming has
  recorded, it holds by its fore-paws while devouring, sitting up the while on its posterior. In
  drinking it is also said to lap water like a Cat. The Tarsier seldom makes any kind of noise, but
  when it does emit a sound, it is a sharp, shrill call. The female produces one, rarely two, young
  at a birth; these are similar to the parents. They are covered with hair, and have the eyes open.
  Mr. Hose further states that the mother often carries her young one about in her mouth, after the
  manner of a Cat. On the second day after its birth, the infant Tarsier can move about by itself.
  By the natives of Sumatra, and, indeed, of most of the islands inhabited by these animals, the
  Tarsiers are held in superstitious dread, their presence in the neighbourhood of the rice-fields
  being supposed to portend misfortune to the owner or to some member of his family.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Their elongated ankle-bones, and their leaping habits, seem to indicate that the
  Galagos and the Chirogales, or Mouse-Lemurs, are the nearest relatives of the Tarsiers.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac">THE TYPICAL LEMURS. FAMILY LEMURIDÆ.</p>

  <p>Under this family heading are included the whole of the remaining members of the Sub-order.
  They all possess certain main characters in common; but on account of the presence or <span
  class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span>absence of certain subordinate features in some of the
  groups, the family has been further subdivided into four sub-families. The more important
  characters which they have in common are the thick woolly fur, the Dog- or Fox-like snout and
  nostrils&mdash;a character obviously distinguishing them from the bulk of the Monkeys, in which
  the nose forms a subsidiary feature, and is not the main part of the face,&mdash;and especially
  the number and form of their teeth. In the centre of the upper jaw there is always a toothless
  gap, or <i>diastema</i>, on each side of which the teeth are arranged according to the following
  formula: I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>,
  C<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span
  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span
  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span> = 36. Among the
  Endrinas, however, the formula is I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span
  class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">1</span><span
  class="ifracd">(1 or 0)</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span
  class="ifracd">2</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span> = 32 or 30 in number. In the upper jaw the incisors are small and
  perpendicular; but in the lower, where they are long and narrow, they protrude horizontally in
  front, and then follow, parallel and close to them, the somewhat thicker canines, the six teeth
  together forming a comb-like series. The anterior pre-molar is always vertically longer than the
  others, and assumes the form and function of the canines in other animals.</p>

  <p>In some genera (e.g., <i>Propithecus</i>), Milne-Edwards has observed that in the young animal
  the cerebellum is more overlapped by the cerebrum (or main brain) than it is later in life; and
  Dr. Major believes that the <i>Lemuridæ</i> are highly specialised members of the Sub-order,
  developed from ancient types which were not unlike the American Monkeys of the family
  <i>Cebidæ</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The Typical Lemurs are arranged in the following four sub-divisions: The Pottos and
  Slow-paced Lemurs (<i>Lorisinæ</i>); the Galagos and Mouse-Lemurs (<i>Galaginæ</i>); the True
  Lemurs (<i>Lemurinæ</i>); and the Endrinas (<i>Indrisinæ</i>).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3 ac">THE SLOW-LEMURS. SUB-FAMILY I. LORISINÆ.</p>

  <p>This Sub-family has been constituted to receive a small number of Lemurs, which, although
  occupying limited areas in two widely separated continents&mdash;one genus being African and the
  others Asiatic&mdash;present certain characters in common. They are recognised by having soft
  woolly fur, a triangular head and pointed face, very large and staring eyes, set close together,
  while their ears are naked along their margin. Their fore- and hind-limbs are nearly equal. In the
  Asiatic genera the index finger is very small, while in the African it is quite rudimentary and
  nail-less. In both groups the thumb diverges widely from the other fingers, and the great toe is
  directed backwards, but the ankle-bones of the foot are not elongated. The tail is either so short
  as to be quite concealed in the fur, or is less than one-third of the length of the body.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the skull the squamosal region with the outer and posterior portion of the ear capsules (the
  periotic) are inflated. The dental formula of the Slow-Lemurs is the same as given above for the
  family generally. In the upper jaw, the two incisors are usually equal, but, if unequal, the inner
  incisor is always the larger (Fig. 6); the vertically long canine, which is separated by a gap
  from the anterior pre-molar, presents both in front and behind a neck or cingulum, which is cusped
  behind; the pre-molars are canine-like, and have the cingulum produced behind into a heel (or
  talon). The anterior of the three is <span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span>vertically
  longer than the median, while both the median and posterior have, to the outside, one main cusp
  with a minute one on each side of it, and two inner cusps; the molars are all cingulate, and have
  to the outside two main cusps (separated by a minute cusp) and two inner cusps, the outer and
  inner cusps alternating. Of the anterior and median molars, the two main outside cusps are
  sub-equal, and are flanked on each side by a minute cusp; the posterior molar is short and wide,
  and has only one minute cusp in front of its anterior main cusp. Of the lower jaw, the pre-molars
  are canine-like, the anterior being vertically long and having a posterior heel; the posterior
  pre-molar, which differs in size from the anterior, presents two main cusps to the outside and one
  minute cusp in front; the molars, both anterior and median, are four-cusped, with a minute cusp in
  front, the posterior being five-cusped, while all have their front cusps vertically taller than
  the hind ones.</p>

  <p>Among the <i>Lorisinæ</i> the dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together number from twenty-one to
  twenty-three. The cæcum, at the junction of the larger and smaller intestine, is long. The main
  artery of the fore- and hind-limbs breaks up into a <i>rete mirabile</i> of numerous small
  parallel branches.</p>

  <p>The Slow-Lemurs are distributed in the western parts of the African continent, and in the
  Indian, Malayan and Indo-Chinese portions of the Oriental region. It is a remarkable fact that
  this group should be confined to one portion of Africa and be entirely absent from Madagascar, the
  country where the Lemurs form so characteristic a feature in the fauna.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <i>Lorisinæ</i> embrace three genera, the Pottos (<i>Perodicticus</i>) from the
  African continent; the Slender Loris (<i>Loris</i>), and the Slow-Loris (<i>Nycticebus</i>), both
  of which inhabit the Oriental region.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This genus contains two species, both confined to the West Coast of Africa. The Pottos are
  slender-bodied animals, with oval heads and blunt Dog-shaped muzzles. Their eyes are large and
  full, and their external ears erect, with shelf-like lamellæ inside. They have slender and
  sub-equal limbs. The second digit of the fore-limb is rudimentary and nail-less; it is supported
  on one wrist-bone, and has two phalanges or finger-bones. The great toe is opposable, and the
  fourth and fifth digits of both limbs are united together by membrane as far as the first joint.
  The processes of the vertebræ in the neck and back are long and protruding. The tail is very
  short.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The pre-maxillæ (which carry the incisor teeth) do not project in front, nor does
  the bony palate extend farther back than the end of the posterior molar teeth. Of the upper teeth
  the incisors are equal in size (Fig. 6); the median and posterior pre-molars have on their crowns
  three cusps, of which the two outer are the larger; the anterior and median molars are cingulate,
  have four-cusped crowns, and are larger than the pre-molars; the posterior is narrow from before
  backwards, and its crown presents only two or three cusps. Of the lower teeth, the anterior
  pre-molar is recurved and larger than the canine, with a ridge on its inner face and a cusped heel
  behind; the median and posterior ones are shorter than their anterior fellow, each having a strong
  posterior cusped heel; the anterior and median <span class="pagenum" id="page27">{27}</span>molars
  have their crowns four-cusped and are nearly equal in length; the crown of the posterior molar is
  4-5-cusped, and has a ridge joining its anterior heel to its front outer cusp. Transverse and
  oblique ridges are well marked on the crowns of both the upper and lower cheek-teeth.</p>

  <p>Fur silver-grey at the base of the hairs, with reddish-brown tips in younger, and dark
  golden-brown in older, individuals.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Potto is one of the oldest known members of the Lemuroid group,
  having been described in 1704 by Bosman, who met with it on his voyage to Guinea. It was, however,
  lost sight of until 1825, when it was rediscovered in Sierra Leone and fully described by Bennett
  in 1830. It is known also from Gaboon.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Both species of Potto are nocturnal and arboreal, and are exceedingly slow
  in their movements. In catching <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>insects or flies,
  which form part of their food, they proceed with extraordinary deliberation, never quickening
  their movements, and yet rarely, if ever, missing their prey.</p>

  <p>Bosman in his description of the Gold Coast of Guinea, gives a woodcut of the Potto, which, he
  says, is a "Draught of a Creature, by the <i>Negroes</i> called <i>Potto</i>, but known to us by
  the Name of Sluggard, doubtless from its lazy, sluggish Nature; a whole day being little enough
  for it to advance ten Steps forward.</p>

  <p>"Some Writers affirm, that when this Creature has climbed upon a Tree, he doth not leave it
  until he hath eaten up not only the Fruit, but the leaves intirely; and then descends fat and in
  very good case in order to get up into another Tree; but before his slow pace can compass this, he
  becomes as poor and lean as 'tis possible to imagine: And if the trees be high, or the way
  anything distant, and he meets with nothing on his journey, he inevitably dies of Hunger, betwixt
  one tree and the other. Thus 'tis represented by others, but I will not undertake for the Truth of
  it; though the <i>Negroes</i> are apt to believe something like it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"This is such a horrible ugly Creature that I don't believe anything besides so
  very disagreeable is to be found on the whole Earth; the Print is a very lively Description of it:
  Its Fore-feet are very like Hands, the Head strangely disproportionately large; that from whence
  this Print was taken was of a pale Mouse colour: but it was then very young, and his Skin yet
  smooth, but when old, as I saw one at <i>Elmina</i> in the year 1699, 'tis red and covered with a
  sort of Hair as thick set as Flocks of Wool. I know nothing more of this Animal, than that 'tis
  impossible to look on him without Horrour, and that he hath nothing very particular but his odious
  Ugliness."</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;A slender-bodied animal covered with close, soft, and woolly fur. Head
  short and round; eyes very large; nose narrow and much pointed; ears small and haired externally;
  tips nude. Limbs long, remarkably slender and angularly bent; hands and feet covered with short
  hair; index-finger with three phalanges and finger-bones.</p>

  <p>Skull with eye-sockets closely approximating, in the centre separated only by a thin plate of
  bone; nasal and premaxillary bones prolonged forward to support the narrow pointed nose; cranium,
  along its base to end of nasal bones, two inches long, broader across the orbits than behind in
  front of the articulation of lower jaw; bony palate extending back beyond the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page32">{32}</span>posterior molar tooth. In the upper jaw the incisors are
  small and equal (Fig. 6); posterior pre-molar similar to, but smaller than the anterior molar;
  anterior molar with the oblique ridge on crown well developed; crown of posterior molar
  four-cusped, that of the posterior lower molar five-cusped. Dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together,
  23; caudal vertebræ, 6-8.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is four times the length of the body.</p>

  <p><b>Adult.</b>&mdash;Dingy grey above, darker on back, paler on lower back; the hairs tipped
  with white. Sides of body, outside of fore- and hind-limbs dingy white, with a faint rufous wash
  on the outside of the hind-limbs. Face and ring round eyes dark greyish-brown; streak along nose
  white, branching on forehead above the eyes on each side into a broad ring encircling the dark
  ocular ring; this frontal branch sometimes absent. Under side greyish-white. Hairs of fur
  greyish-white at base, dark in the middle, and tipped with white. Length, 8 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;More rust-coloured than the adult.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Slender Loris is common in the lower forests of Ceylon and of
  Southern India, south of the Godaveri river, as well as in those of the Eastern Ghats.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This curious, emaciated-looking, little creature is nocturnal, living
  entirely in trees. It sleeps during the day rolled up in a ball, with its head between its legs,
  grasping its perch with its hands. According to Jerdon these animals are occasionally brought in
  large numbers to the Madras market, their eyes being a favourite remedy of the Tamil doctors for
  ophthalmic diseases.</p>

  <p>In its movements it is slightly more active than the Slow-Loris. Its food consists of succulent
  leaves, honey, insects, birds' eggs, and small animals.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Body larger and fuller than in <i>Loris</i>, and covered <span
  class="pagenum" id="page34">{34}</span>with close and woolly fur. Head short and round. Eyes
  large, set close together, and having a gentle expression; face short and flat; muzzle less
  projecting than in <i>Loris</i>; ears small, rounded, hairy, and nearly buried in the fur; neck
  short; tail invisible externally. Limbs short; index-finger small, containing three bones; toes
  remaining spontaneously contracted after death. Top of skull with prominent crests, globular
  behind; facial bones conspicuously projecting in front; orbits large, their inner margins
  separated from each other by a narrow flat space. Pre-maxillæ not produced far in front; hind
  border of bony palate not extending backwards beyond the median molar. Of the upper teeth, the
  inner incisor larger than the outer, one often absent on each side; canine vertically very long,
  with a gap between it and the anterior pre-molar; anterior pre-molar elongate, the posterior
  differing considerably from the anterior molar, and having a short cusped heel behind; posterior
  molar with a three-cusped crown. Teeth of lower jaw agreeing with those in the diagnosis of the
  family (<i>suprà</i>, p. <a href="#page24">24</a>). Vertebræ in dorsal and lumbar regions together
  23 or 24. The long flexor muscle of the thumb, so characteristic of the Anthropoid Apes, is
  present in <i>Nycticebus</i>. The interlacement of the tendons of the muscles of its foot
  (according to Huxley and Murie) closely resembles the arrangement in the higher Primates. The long
  flexor muscle of the toes (<i>flexor longus digitorum</i>) is very large, and has one important
  origin on the lower end (internal condyle) of the thigh-bone correlated with the powerful grasp of
  its hind-limbs. The female bears one young at a birth.</p>

  <p>Above, ashy-grey, rather paler below; more or less silvery on the back, often rufescent on the
  rump, with the hairs dark ashy at the roots; dorsal stripe from crown to loins chestnut <span
  class="pagenum" id="page35">{35}</span>brown; circle round the eyes dark brown; a white line down
  the nose between the eyes; oral patch, including the ears, brown.</p>

  <p>The Slow-Loris varies greatly in size and colour in the different regions it inhabits, and its
  varieties have been recognised by many naturalists as distinct species.</p>

  <p>Every shade of colour occurs among specimens from different habitats. The colour varies between
  rufescent grey, or greyish-rufous, or white (with a brown tinge showing through from below) and
  silvery grey. The dorsal stripe varies from rufous to dull grey or even black, expanding out, or
  not, on the crown of the head, arms, and cheeks, bifurcating to the orbital rings and ear-patches,
  or to one or other only. Sometimes the dorsal stripe and face-markings are wanting altogether.
  Under side varying from pale rufescent grey to light rufous or dull grey. Length of head and body
  varying from 12¾ to 16 inches.</p>

  <p>"It is an interesting fact," observes St. George Mivart, "that as far as concerns the skull and
  dentition, the Asiatic <i>Nycticebus</i> far more resembles the African <i>Perodicticus</i> than
  it does its Oriental neighbour <i>Loris</i>."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Slow-Loris has a comparatively wide and interrupted range. It is
  common in the dense mountain forests of Assam and Burma (where it has received the distinctive
  appellation of <i>N. bengalensis</i>), as well as in Tenasserim and the Malayan Peninsula. It has
  also been obtained in Siam and Cochin-China, whence it has been described as a distinct species
  (<i>N. cinereus</i>), from its silvery-grey fur; while it also occurs&mdash;somewhat reduced in
  size&mdash;and often (but not invariably) without the upper incisor teeth&mdash;in the islands of
  Sumatra, Java, and Borneo with its surrounding islet groups, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page36">{36}</span>as well as in the Philippine Islands. The form from the last-named
  localities (figured on Plate III.) has generally been recognised as <i>N. javanicus</i>; but, from
  a careful examination of the material in the British Museum, it appears to the present writer that
  the specimens from all these localities merge so insensibly into each other that it is impossible
  to separate them into distinct species. The Slow-Loris, though occurring on the north-eastern
  frontier of India, has not yet been discovered in the Himalayas.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Like the Slender Loris, the Slow-Loris is arboreal and nocturnal, hardly
  differing in its food and general habits from the latter. It lives alone or in pairs, and moves
  about very slowly, with its head curiously drawn up close to its body, with the latter arched and
  its limbs very angularly disposed. Colonel Tickell has observed it, however, to raise itself on
  its hind-legs and throw itself upon an insect. It is generally silent, but can utter a low growl
  when angry. In captivity it becomes docile, but is never very long-lived. Tickell records that "it
  never by choice leaves the trees.... It climbs readily and grasps with great tenacity. If placed
  on the ground, it proceeds, if frightened, in a wavering kind of trot, the limbs placed at right
  angles. It sleeps rolled up in a ball, its head and hands buried between its thighs, and wakes up
  in the dusk of the evening to commence its nocturnal rambles." Another observer records: "When he
  climbs he first lays hold of the branch with one of his hands and then with the other. When he has
  obtained a firm hold with both hands, he moves one of his hind-paws, and after firmly grasping the
  branch with it, he moves the other. He never quits his hold with his hind-paws until he has
  obtained a secure grasp with his hands." The remarkable tenacity of grasp in its feet is largely
  due to the <span class="pagenum" id="page37">{37}</span>automatic action of the flexor muscles of
  the toes (the digits continuing flexed even after death), and the mere extension of the leg
  largely contributes to the "effortless suspension of the body" (<i>Murie</i>), as in the
  Fruit-Bats and other species which hang passively by their hind-limbs. (<i>Huxley.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp5">Dr. Coghlan, speaking of the Chinese race (<i>N. cinereus</i>), says: "They make a
  curious chattering noise when angry, and when pleased at night they utter a short though tuneful
  whistle of one unvaried note; this whistle is thought by Chinese sailors, who take them to sea, to
  denote the coming of wind.... Their intelligence seems to be much below that of the Monkey.... The
  Slow-Loris, when newly-born, is about four inches long, and covered with fur; it holds on by its
  four hands to the mother's fur, and in that attitude sucks the milk from its parent's breast."</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE GALAGOS. SUB-FAMILY II. GALAGINÆ.</p>

  <p>The Lemurs comprised in the present Sub-family are divisible into two groups&mdash;those
  inhabiting the mainland of Africa and those confined to the island of Madagascar. The exclusively
  African species, the True Galagos, constitute the single genus <i>Galago</i>; while the Malagasy
  group is represented by three genera, the so-called Fat-tailed Lemurs (<i>Opolemur</i>), the
  Dwarf-Lemurs (<i>Microcebus</i>), and the Mouse-Lemurs (<i>Chirogale</i>). The members of this
  Sub-family vary considerably in size, and are all covered with soft woolly fur. Their ears
  especially are largely developed, being more or less membranaceous and naked, and their sense of
  hearing very acute. The eyes are large and the tail always elongated. In the skull the length of
  the muzzle is less that the greatest longitudinal diameter of the orbit (except in the genus
  <i>Galago</i>). <span class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>Their teeth number 36&mdash;18 above
  and 18 below&mdash;as in the bulk of the <i>Lemuridæ</i>; the upper molars present on their crown
  an oblique ridge from the outer hind cusp to the inner front cusp. The ankle region
  (<i>tarsus</i>) of the hind-limb is much elongated, through the lengthening of two of its bones
  (the <i>calcaneum</i> and <i>naviculare</i>): this feature occurring to a greater extent among the
  African than among the Malagasy species. The mammæ are four in number, two on the breast and two
  on the abdomen.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Many of the species hibernate during the dry winter season, and to enable them to
  survive, they accumulate during the summer months a thick deposit of fat over their bodies, more
  especially at the root of the tail, a fact first conspicuously observed in the Opolemurids. This
  fat is absorbed for their sustenance during their prolonged torpidity.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE AFRICAN GALAGOS. GENUS
  GALAGO.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Galago</i>, Geoffr., Mag. Encycl., Ann. 2, i., p. 49 (1796).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The African Galagos are generally larger in size than the Madagascar members of the group, and
  have the snout produced beyond the lower jaw. Their ears are large, membranaceous, and have a very
  mobile contractile hinder edge, the animal having the power of folding them up at will. The eyes
  are also large and approximated; the fingers and toes very long and slender, and the tail thick
  and bushy.</p>

  <p>The skull presents a high, broad, and round brain-case, with a relatively short facial region.
  The pre-maxillary bones are very much reduced, so that the muzzle, measured from the anterior
  margin of the orbit forward, is shorter than the longitudinal diameter of the orbits. The bony
  palate is also relatively short. Compared with those of the Madagascar genera <span
  class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>the orbits are, according to Dr. Forsyth Major, much
  broader vertically and horizontally in the genus <i>Galago</i>. The squamosal region of the skull
  and the outer portion of the ear-capsules (the periotic) are large and inflated. The mandible (or
  lower jaw) has its lower hind edge, or angle, produced backward.</p>

  <p>The dentition of the Galagos presents several important characters. In respect to their upper
  teeth, the incisors are small, equal, and have a hind cusp on the cingulum. A distinct gap exists
  between the canine and the pre-molar teeth. Of the pre-molars, the anterior one is canine-like,
  and is equally distant from the canine and its own next neighbour. To the outside it has one main
  cusp, and generally one minute supplementary cusp on each side. The median pre-molar shows three
  cusps, and one strong inner front cusp. The posterior pre-molar is always molar-like. It has one
  front supplementary and two main cusps to the outside; and one front and one supplementary hind
  cusp to the inside: it has also on the crown the oblique ridge spoken of above.</p>

  <p>The molars have a deep concavity on their hind border, due to the development of the cingulum
  on the inner half only of that border of the tooth; to the outside they present two main cusps
  (and often supplementary minute fore and hind cusps); while to the inside they present two cusps,
  and also an intermediate cusp in front between the two fore cusps; the oblique ridge is also here
  present; the hindmost molar is three-cusped. The five hind molars are, therefore, nearly equal in
  size. In the lower jaw the pre-molars are complicated. The anterior and median are canine-like and
  procumbent, with a cusped heel behind; the posterior is distinguished from a molar only by the
  lesser size of its fore-part. The molars are also complicated; the anterior and median are equal
  in size <span class="pagenum" id="page40">{40}</span>and four-cusped&mdash;the two front cusps
  (united by a ridge) are taller than the two hind ones, and there is a minute cusp between the two
  hind cusps. The posterior molar, though smaller than the others, is five-cusped. The oblique ridge
  is not present in the lower molars.</p>

  <p>The brain of the Galagos is narrower and shallower than that in the <i>Lemurinæ</i>.</p>

  <p>The female gives birth to two or three young at a time.</p>

  <p>According to Dr. Forsyth Major, who has made the Lemuroidea a special study, the smaller
  African Galagos have departed less from the primitive Lemuroid type than the Madagascar genera, in
  which greater specialisation has taken place.</p>

  <p>The members of the genus <i>Galago</i> are widely distributed on the African continent, but are
  unknown in Madagascar. They range throughout the dense forest regions, from Abyssinia in the
  north-east, to Senegambia in the west, and southward as far as Natal and Mozambique.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Almost all the Galagos are nocturnal. They are chiefly arboreal, and when they
  descend to the ground they advance by hops on their long hind-limbs. They feed chiefly on fruits,
  insects, birds, and birds' eggs.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Garnett's Galago is essentially nocturnal in its habits,
  feeding on fruits. According to Mr. Bartlett, it exhibited in confinement no fear of Cats or Dogs,
  and was very sprightly and tricky. It kills all it can pounce upon and overpower. On the ground it
  jumps upright, like a Kangaroo, on its hind-limbs, without using its fore feet, covering several
  feet at a spring.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Senegal Galago is nocturnal and arboreal, occurring in the
  forests singly or in pairs. It makes a nest of leaves in the fork of a tree, and during its
  diurnal rest it either retreats thither, or composes itself on a branch, unwilling to move, and
  staring at passers-by, with its tail invariably folded across its body and round its neck. After
  sunset, these Galagos become lively, and in their movements they evince great activity; they
  spring from branch to branch, and even from tree to tree, with extraordinary facility (as both Sir
  Andrew Smith and Sir John Kirk have recorded), often clearing at single leaps distances of six
  feet. When seen in the dim light they may easily be taken for Bats. "They always seize with one of
  their fore feet the branch upon which they intend to rest. In their manners they manifest
  considerable resemblance to Monkeys, particularly in their propensity to the practice of
  ridiculous grimaces." (<i>Sir A. Smith.</i>) In this habit they resemble also some species of the
  genus Lemur. Their food consists chiefly of fruits and of insects. The female produces generally
  two young at a birth.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Head round; muzzle pointed; eyes very large; ears also very large,
  long, nude, and membranaceous; fingers and toes very long, slender, and fine. Tail thick, round,
  and longer than the body; ankle-bones elongated. Length of body, 8¼ inches; tail, 10 inches. Head
  brownish-grey; a narrow black ring round the eyes; a streak from the forehead down the nose
  whitish; back greyish-brown, washed (sometimes markedly) with rufous on the upper back, fading out
  towards the root of the tail; the latter black or greyish-black. Outside of arms and legs washed
  with rufous, sometimes with a white spot on the shoulder-joint and over the groin; posterior
  aspect of legs sooty-black; cheeks, sides of nose, entire under surface, and inner side of limbs
  creamy-white with a rufous-washed bar across the chest. Muzzle shorter than the diameter of
  eye-socket. Incisors seen from the side, more or less hidden by the canines; anterior upper
  pre-molar very canine-like, relatively much produced longitudinally, with an interval between the
  anterior and median pre-molars; posterior upper pre-molar four-cusped, and with an intermediate
  cusp on the oblique ridge; posterior upper molar almost equal in size to the median one.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species has been recorded from the Gaboon, in West Africa, and
  from Fernando Po, whence it was first obtained by Captain Allen, R.N., in 1837.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Although little or nothing has been recorded of its habits, it
  is unlikely that they differ much from those of the species already known.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Head round; body short and thick; snout very narrow; long bristles on
  the face, corners of the eyes, and sides of the nose; ears long, oval, membranaceous, transparent,
  the inner margin haired; eyes large and projecting; nose elongated in front, and projecting above
  the upper lip; fingers slender; wrist, ankle, hands and feet short-haired; digits naked; tail
  longer than body, round and slender. Length, 5 inches; tail, 8 inches.</p>

  <p>Basal part of hair Mouse-grey. Upper side reddish-brown, more rufous down the back, and on the
  tail, except its distal half, which is darker. Top of head and sides of face darker; a narrow
  white streak from the brow down the nose; ring round the eyes dark, wider on the inner side; chin,
  throat, inner side of limbs, and under surface of body creamy-white. In the young, which remains
  blind for several days after birth, the white nose-streak is less defined, and the fur is shorter
  and lighter than that of the parents.</p>

  <p>Orbits approximating; front bones of jaw (the pre-maxillæ) projecting beyond the incisors;
  upper median pre-molar teeth with enlarged heel, and with one or two diminutive cusps; upper
  molars with a small cusp on the oblique ridge; wrist-bones elongated.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Demidoff's Galago occurs in Senegal, in West Africa, and has been
  obtained in Central Africa in the <span class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span>Niam-Niam country
  by Dr. Schweinfurth, and in the Monbuttu country by the late Emin Pasha.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Writing of Demidoff's Galago in a letter from Africa addressed
  to Mr. A. Murray, Mr. Thomson says: "It was a most interesting and amusing pet, not only quite
  tame, but manifesting strong attachment. It was a very epitome of zoology, of the size and colour
  of a large Rat; it had the tail of a Squirrel, the facial outline of the Fox, the membranous ears
  of the Bat, the eyes and somewhat of the manners of the Owl in its cool odd way of peering at
  objects, the long slender fingers of a lean old man who habitually eats down his nails, and all
  the mirthfulness and agility of a diminutive Monkey. It hated its cage at night, but delighted to
  leap among the bars of the chairs ranged purposely round the table for it. It could clear a
  horizontal distance of at least six feet at a bound.... It possessed a curious power of folding
  its membranous ears back upon themselves and somewhat corrugating them at pleasure; and it
  appeared to me that the palms of its hands and feet were endowed in some degree with the power of
  suction.... I have seen it maintain itself in positions where the mere lateral pressure of its
  limbs appeared to be inadequate for the purpose.... I never saw it muster courage enough to attack
  either a Grasshopper or a Mantis."...</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Fur Mouse-grey at base, with white tips; pupils of eyes oval and
  vertical; ears very large and naked; hairs on face and cheeks short; feet broad, short, and
  strong; toes <span class="pagenum" id="page47">{47}</span>broad, with rounded discs; thumb very
  broad; tail very long. Entirely pale grey over the head, face, cheeks, body, and tail; throat
  nearly white; hands and feet dark brown, nearly black; nose black; ears nearly black. One of the
  largest species of the Sub-family. Length, 12 inches; tail, 16 inches long.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species was discovered by Mr. Monteiro in Cuio Bay on the West
  Coast of Africa, to the south of Loanda; and the late Captain Cameron, R.N., brought a few
  specimens home with him from Bailunda, on his return from his celebrated march across the
  Continent.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Little is known of this species from observation in the field.
  A few specimens have reached Europe, and on one that lived in the Zoological Gardens in London,
  Mr. Bartlett made the following observation: "The animal has the power of turning its ears back by
  the complex muscles of their external aspect, and folding them up when at rest. When moving about
  or in search of food they spread out and stand upward and forward, reminding one of those of the
  Aye-Aye; but when folded back and down, the animal's face bears a strong resemblance to the
  Douroucouli (<i>Nyctipithecus</i>)."</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Hair long and woolly. Head round; muzzle more elongated than in other
  Galagos; nose-pad with a deep <span class="pagenum" id="page48">{48}</span>furrow; eyes large;
  ears large, the upper half membranaceous and nude; tail long, thick and bushy; fourth digit of
  hand and foot longest; fingers and toes not united by a membrane, but with flat disc-like
  terminations.</p>

  <p>Hair Mouse-grey at base, silver-grey at tips; the hair on the belly white tipped, sometimes
  entirely white; hairs on back longer and with black tips. General colour yellowish-brown, with a
  lighter band from the forehead along the centre of the nose and round the eye-circles, which are
  darker. Iris reddish-brown. Top of head rusty-brown; back grey; sides of body, cheeks, and outer
  side of limbs grey, faintly washed with rusty-red; whole under side grey or yellowish-white. Tail
  ferruginous; hands and feet deep rufous-brown; short hairs of digits blackish-brown. Length, 13
  inches; tail, 16 inches. The female has the pelage similar to that of the male.</p>

  <p>The coast form, which has been described as Kirk's Galago (<i>G. kirkii</i>), is only a variety
  of the present species. In it the fur is pale ashy-grey; the hairs at the base Mouse-grey, tipped
  with grey, with longer black hairs distributed over the body; cheeks, inner sides of limbs, and
  under side greyish-white; face, crown, and nape washed with reddish-brown, which extends on the
  outer side of the limbs; lower back more lightly washed; tail, dirty grey.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Great Galago is found on the south-east coast of Africa to 24° S
  lat., and extends into the interior for about 140 miles from Quilimane. Kirk's Galago (<i>G.
  crassicaudata</i>, var. <i>kirkii</i>) is confined to the maritime regions and mangrove forests of
  the east coast. Sir John Kirk states that it has been observed at the Luabo mouth of the Zambesi,
  at Quilimane, and at Mozambique. It has also been procured at Taveita.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page49">{49}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This species, named by the Portuguese "Rat of the Cocoanut
  Palm," nestles by day among the palm fronds, its ears folded up like a Beetle's wing, and, if
  disturbed, it performs feats of agility, darting from one palm to another. "It will spring with
  great rapidity," says Sir John Kirk, "adhering to any object as if it were a lump of wet clay. It
  has one failing,&mdash;should a pot of palm-wine be left on the top of the tree the creature
  drinks to excess, comes down and rushes about intoxicated," and can then be easily caught. "It
  becomes active just after darkness sets in. The rapidity and length of its leaps, which were
  absolutely noiseless, must give great facilities to its capturing live prey. I never knew it give
  a loud call, but it would often make a low chattering noise."</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">In this genus are included a group of Lemurs of very small dimensions, and of which
  the following are the more important characters: The rounded head has a short face covered with
  fur. The eyes are very large and set close together, agreeing well with their nocturnal life. The
  ears are conspicuous, projecting beyond the fur, thin, and membranaceous. The hind-limbs are
  larger than the fore-, the foot being remarkably elongated by the lengthening of the heel-bone
  (<i>Astragalus</i>). The nail of the second finger is pointed, but all the rest are flat. The
  length of the tail exceeds that of the body. In some the orbits are directed outwards instead of
  directly forwards as is generally the case among the members of the Sub-order. Of the teeth in the
  upper jaw, the inner incisors are larger than the outer; the anterior pre-molar is as long <span
  class="pagenum" id="page50">{50}</span>vertically as its median neighbour; while the posterior,
  which is smaller than the anterior molar, has one internal and one large external cusp. Of the
  molars, the inner hind cusp is either small or wanting. The bony palate is long, its hind margin
  extending behind the posterior molar. The pre-maxillary bones, carrying the incisor teeth, are
  largely developed. The mastoid portion of the ear-capsules (periotic) is not inflated as in many
  species of Lemurs. Several of the species of this genus remain somnolent and torpid throughout the
  dry season, in regions where it is then impossible to obtain the vegetable food they require. The
  Mouse-Lemurs are confined to the island of Madagascar.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Snout pointed; eyes prominent; ears moderately large, oval,
  membranaceous, and sparsely-haired externally; tail Rat-like, thick at base, becoming thinner
  towards its extremity. Brain-case of skull less vaulted than in the true Lemurs. Bony palate
  prolonged behind the posterior molar, its hind perforations large; mastoid portion of ear-capsule
  (periotic) not swollen. No gap in upper jaw between the canines and anterior pre-molar teeth;
  anterior upper pre-molar canine-like, and longer than the median; no gap between the anterior and
  median pre-molars; posterior lower molar reduced in size. The anterior milk pre-molar changes
  first, the posterior next, and median last. The posterior upper <span class="pagenum"
  id="page51">{51}</span>milk-molar has one inner and two outer cusps. (<i>Forsyth Major.</i>)
  Heel-bone elongated.</p>

  <p>General colour varying considerably; top of head, neck, and upper part of back, brownish-grey
  or uniform delicate fawn-brown, sometimes "grizzled with silvery-grey" or washed with rufous, more
  especially on the head; rest of back, sides, outer sides of limbs and tail ashy-brown; under side
  and inner side of limbs greyish-white, or white slightly washed with yellowish. Ring round orbits
  and side of nose, black; space between the eyes lighter than the back of the head. Length, 7-8
  inches. The young are dark Mouse-grey.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Milius' Mouse-Lemur, though a rare species, is widely distributed in
  Madagascar, being found in the Ankay Forest on the north-east coast as well as along the west
  coast as far south as Mouroundava.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This beautiful little Lemur, no bigger than a Guinea-pig, is,
  like most of the other species of its group, nocturnal and arboreal, feeding on fruits and
  probably honey. It runs on all fours, but sits up to eat, holding its food in its hands. In the
  winter months it is believed to hibernate in hollow trees. Having scooped out a cavity big enough
  to contain its body, the little animal collects, according to the Rev. G. A. Shaw, sufficient
  loose leaves and grass to cover it; it then retires, and, burying itself in the heap, is sustained
  during its period of hibernation by the store of fat which, during the summer months, becomes
  deposited at the root of the tail, and swells the latter out to an enormous size.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Under this genus are arranged five species of very small Lemurs, whose hind-limbs are longer
  than their fore-, though less so in proportion than is the case among the African Galagos. Their
  snout is also shorter; their eyes are large, approximated together, very prominent and very
  bright, and their ears are elongated. On the ventral surface are situated four mammæ, two on the
  breast and two on the abdomen.</p>

  <p>Of their bony framework, the brain-case is high, broad, and more vaulted than that of either
  the Mouse-Lemurs or the species of the next genus, <i>Opolemur</i>. The facial region is also
  shorter. The mastoid portion of the ear-capsules (periotic bones) and the squamosal region is
  somewhat less inflated than in <i>Galago</i>. With regard to their dentition, the inner upper
  incisor is larger than its outer fellow. Between the upper canine and the anterior pre-molar of
  its own side there exists no gap, nor is there a space between the anterior and the median upper
  pre-molars. The molars have three-cusped crowns, but these cusps are very sharp, and are weaker
  than those in <i>Galago</i>; the intermediate cusp between the two main cusps to the front is
  wanting. The concavity also of the hinder margin (so marked in <i>Galago</i>) is here very slight,
  but the basal ring (<i>cingulum</i>) is swollen internally to form an inner hind cusp. The
  posterior upper molar is smaller than the anterior, and its inner hind cusp is rudimentary. The
  hind border of the bony palate extends to behind the last molar tooth, its posterior perforations
  being very large. The angle of the lower jaw is not produced downwards.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page55">{55}</span></div>

  <p>The foot in the Dwarf-Lemurs is long, on account of the elongation of two of its ankle-bones
  (the <i>cuboid</i> and the <i>naviculare</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">The species of this genus are confined to the island of Madagascar. They are
  entirely nocturnal, as their large eyes and inflated ear-capsules might suggest. They are chiefly

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Of the habits of both this and of the preceding species little
  is known, for they have rarely, if ever, been seen alive by Europeans. According to the Rev. G. A.
  Shaw, the present species lives in the belt of forest-land stretching from the eastern forest into
  the heart of Betsileo, a few miles north of Fianarantsoa, where they are tolerably abundant,
  frequenting the tops of the highest trees. Among these it moves about on all fours (its very stout
  limbs having beautifully perfect hands), using its tail as a balance by twisting it round a
  branch. The tail is, however, not truly prehensile, the animal only employing it to steady itself,
  or to hold on slightly by. This species, whose food consists chiefly of fruit and insects, builds
  a nest in a fork amid the smallest branches near the top of some very high tree, the female
  bringing forth two and sometimes three young at a birth.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The term <i>Opolemur</i>, by which this genus is designated, is not altogether appropriate, and
  is, indeed, even somewhat misleading. It was applied in the first instance to the typical species
  on account of the thickened base of its tail, which in the type-specimen was a very conspicuous
  character. The deposit of fat by which this thickening was caused was not then known to be merely
  transitory&mdash;a store of food collected at the base of the tail and on other parts of the body,
  to supply the needs of the animal during the arid and foodless season, when it retires into a
  state of torpidity. It is now known that <span class="pagenum" id="page62">{62}</span>other
  species of this sub-family (as we have seen above in the case of the Mouse-Lemurs), which are
  generically distinct from <i>Opolemur</i>, share this peculiarity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The two species included in this genus are intermediate between the Mouse-Lemurs
  and the Dwarf-Lemurs, and are really more nearly related to the former than to the latter. The
  skull is flat and depressed as in <i>Chirogale</i>, and the brain-case small and almost vertical
  behind. The posterior foramina in the palate are small. In respect to their dentition, the cusps
  of the upper molars are blunter and shorter than in the Mouse-Lemurs, but less so than among the
  Dwarf-Lemurs; the hind inner cusps of the anterior and median molars are large, and the ridge from
  the inner cusp is less intimately joined to the two outer cusps than in the Dwarf-Lemurs.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE TRUE LEMURS. SUB-FAMILY III. LEMURINÆ.</p>

  <p>The third sub-family of the <i>Lemuridæ</i> contains the True Lemurs, which are characterised
  by the possession of a soft, thick, and woolly fur, the head rounded behind, with a specially
  elongated muzzle. They have small and oval ears, with the exterior aspect covered with long hair,
  but the inside naked, except round the margin. Their hind-limbs do not show so great a
  disproportionate length compared to that of the fore-limbs, as in the next sub-family, the
  <i>Indrisinæ</i>. The ankle-bones (<i>tarsus</i>) are only slightly elongated, and their toes are
  not united by a membrane. Their long and bushy tail is sometimes longer and sometimes shorter than
  the body. The females produce one or two, nearly naked, young at a birth, the mammæ being either
  two or four in number. The skull presents a central ridge on the frontal bone, and its facial
  portion is much elongated, the inter-orbital space being depressed and wider, and the orbits also
  directed somewhat outward and less straightforwardly than in several of the genera already
  noticed. The maxillary bones are generally much reduced, and the incisor teeth carried by them not
  unfrequently entirely aborted. The teeth in this Sub-family vary in number from 32 to 36, the
  dental formula being I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">(0-2)</span><span
  class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">1</span><span
  class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span>. The foot is slightly elongated by the lengthening of the
  <i>naviculare</i> bone of the ankle, the others being short. In the wrist (<i>carpus</i>) the
  central bone (<i>centrale</i>) may be present or absent; its absence, however, is a character
  which is met with otherwise only in Man, the Chimpanzees, and the Endrina and some other Lemurs,
  to be described later on. The cæcum is not markedly developed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page65">{65}</span></div>

  <p>The external coloration of the species of this Sub-family is remarkably variable, the variation
  being chiefly in the upper portion of the hairs, as their base is generally slate-grey.</p>

  <p>The sub-family <i>Lemurinæ</i> embraces four genera: the True Lemurs (<i>Lemur</i>), of which
  there are now eight recognised species; the Hattock (<i>Mixocebus</i>), with a solitary species;
  the Gentle-Lemurs (<i>Hapalemur</i>), containing two species, and the Sportive-Lemurs
  (<i>Lepidolemur</i>), with seven species. Some of the most elegantly coloured species in the
  Animal Kingdom belong to this group. They are gregarious, and most of them arboreal, though some
  are not so. They form rather an exception to the general rule among Lemurs, in not being
  nocturnal. They feed during the morning and evening, emitting loud cries as they move about, and
  during the heat of the day, they often lie stretched out in the sun; at night they rest with their
  long tails coiled about them. In their mode of progression they are more quadrupedal than most of
  the other Lemuroids; they jump, walk, or run on all fours. Their food consists of fruits, birds'
  eggs, birds and insects. Their infants are carried about close to, and concealed amid, the hair of
  their mother's breast; when older they cling to her back.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The True Lemurs are all inhabitants of Madagascar and of the adjacent Comoro
  Islands. They are unknown on the African continent.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This genus contains the typical Lemurs, in their most restricted sense. They are characterised
  by having a very <span class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>Fox-like head, and an elongate and
  tapering face, shelving on each side of the nose. A long fringe of hair surrounds their chin and
  cheeks. They have all large and tufted ears, and large eyes, with superciliary ridges rising
  higher than the forehead. Their tail is always half as long as the body at least. The fore-limbs
  are somewhat shorter than the hind-limbs, and both the wrist and ankles are haired. The ankle is
  not elongated, nor is the great toe as large as in the next family&mdash;the <i>Indrisinæ</i>. On
  the outside of the palm of the hand and under the base of the fingers are situated fleshy pads,
  giving them greater grasping power. The True Lemurs have only one pair of mammæ, which are
  situated on the breast.</p>

  <p>In the skull the facial region is much elongated, its measurement from the anterior margin of
  the orbit forward being greater than the longitudinal diameter of the orbit, and the space between
  the eye-sockets is narrow and depressed. The bony palate is short, extending back only to the
  posterior end of the median molar. The posterior portion of the ear-capsules (the mastoidal and
  squamosal regions) is not inflated&mdash;a character which separates this genus from
  <i>Galago</i>. The pre-maxillary bones are large and protrude in front, if the skull be viewed
  from the side. The angle of the lower jaw is not produced downwards and backwards. In some species
  a large maxillary sinus projects into the anterior part of the orbit; in some also the <i>foramen
  rotundum</i> does not coalesce with the sphenoidal fissure (see page <a href="#page11">11</a>),
  but has a distinct opening. The teeth are of the normal number, namely thirty-six. In the upper
  jaw the incisors are small, sub-equal, and situated anteriorly to the canines and are not in
  contact with each other, or with the latter. The canines are very large, tusk-like, and set in an
  excavated notch on the jaw. All the pre-molars <span class="pagenum" id="page67">{67}</span>have
  one main cusp to the outside; the anterior pre-molar, however, has a supplementary minute front
  cusp, while the median has in addition one large interior cusp; both it and the posterior
  pre-molars are vertically taller than their anterior fellow. The molars have two inner cusps, and
  two main outer cusps with a supplementary minute fore cusp, as well as two cusps on the ridge
  joining the fore and hind outer cusps; the posterior molar&mdash;the smallest of the
  three&mdash;is, however, larger than the posterior pre-molar, and has only the front inner cusp
  and no supplementary external cusp. The lower jaw shows a gap between the canine and the anterior
  pre-molar. The anterior pre-molar, which is vertically taller than the rest, is edged and cutting,
  taking the place of a tusk; the anterior and median pre-molars are also separated by a small
  space; the latter, which is equal in vertical height to the posterior, has an inner cusp and a low
  cusped heel. The molars have two outer main cusps, of which the front one is more developed than
  the hind one, and two inner cusps, often with an intermediate cusp between them; the pair of fore
  and the pair of hind cusps are joined by transverse ridges, and the two outside cusps by a
  backwardly directed semicircular ridge; the posterior molar is four-cusped.</p>

  <p>The dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together do not exceed twenty in number.</p>

  <p>The hind portion of the cerebellum is large, which points to intellectual inferiority in the
  True Lemurs as compared with the Apes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The species of this genus are all confined to the island of Madagascar and some of
  the smaller adjacent islands. They are gregarious, living in large companies in the forests,
  feeding on fruits, insects, and such small animals, birds, and lizards <span class="pagenum"
  id="page68">{68}</span>as they may capture. Like the Howlers of S. America and the Gibbons of the
  East Indies, they are very noisy. Their agility is wonderfully great, and is displayed chiefly in
  the evening. During the brighter hours of the day they sit somnolent, either alone with their
  heads buried between their arms, their tail coiled round the neck, or in twos or threes embracing
  each other with their arms. In walking they use their fore-limbs less as hands, and more as feet
  than do the members of the next family&mdash;the <i>Indrisinæ</i>&mdash;both when on the ground,
  as well as when climbing among the trees.</p>

  <p>The Ruffed or Variable Lemur derives its name from the remarkable variability of its external
  markings: so much is this the case, indeed, that not a few of them have been described as distinct
  species. This variability appears to be entirely individual, and is by no means constant. The
  Black-mantled variety has the back of the neck, the shoulders and interscapular region entirely
  black. Another form has the ears, the ruff, and a bar across the muzzle extending over and in
  front of the eyes, joining the ruff, pure white; the fore-arms, legs, a bar across the buttocks
  joining the thighs greyish-white; face, legs, and tail black; a ring encircling the body like a
  belt between the fore- and hind-limbs, yellowish-white; rest of body dark reddish-brown. A third
  variety has the ears, ruff, and outer side of the arms and legs pure white; the flanks rusty-red,
  the rest of the body black.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Red-ruffed Lemur</span> (<i>L. ruber</i>) is a very well-marked variety of
  the same species, and may easily be recognised by the ears, ruff and whole upper surface of body
  being dark rusty-red, with the outer surface of thighs and legs white; or, the ears, ruff and
  whole upper surface (except a white patch on the back of the neck) may be dark brown, with a white
  garter on each ankle; otherwise it may be entirely black. It is this variety which we have figured
  on Plate VII.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Throughout the north-east of Madagascar.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Ruffed Lemur, called by the natives "Varikossi," has a
  loud, harsh and powerful voice, which can be heard for a long distance.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Ears tufted, with long hairs continuing down the side of the neck to
  the angle of the mouth.</p>

  <p><b>Male.</b>&mdash;Entirely black.</p>

  <p><b>Female.</b>&mdash;Formerly described as a distinct species, and known as the White-whiskered
  Lemur (<i>L. leucomystax</i>). Face and lips black, darkest on the nose, round the eyes and hinder
  part of the head; forehead blackish-grey; whiskers and ear-tufts white, almost concealing the
  ears. General colour of body rich ferruginous brown, darker on the middle of the back; arms, legs
  and neck reddish-yellow; tail whiter; throat, under side of body and inner side of limbs
  creamy-white.</p>

  <p>There is a considerable amount of variation in this species. Some individuals have the lower
  back and base of tail white; the belly greyish-white, the feet brown, and the toes black. In
  others the black frontal spot is wanting, the back of the head being reddish-white; the basal half
  of the tail is dark orange-red, remainder of the body rich rusty-brown. On the fore-arm is a
  cluster of stiff hairs, which occurs in association with a large underlying sweat-gland, whose
  function is not yet understood.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The north-west coast of Madagascar.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The special habits of this species of Lemur are unknown, but in all
  probability they agree with those of the group in general, as given under the heading of the
  genus. It is said to utter a coarse grunting call-note.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The young males are born black like the father, and the young females have the
  colour of the mother. Dr. Sclater has observed that in specimens in confinement in the Zoological
  Gardens, in London, the female carried her young one transversely across her belly, its long tail
  passing round her back and then round its own neck.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page77">{77}</span></div>

  <p>On the fore-arm above the wrist-joint there is, in both sexes, a comb-like bony outgrowth
  (becoming in old males a prominent spur) continuous with the palm of the hand by means of a narrow
  strip of black, hairless skin; near it there is a cluster of long stiff hairs over an underlying
  sweat-gland, the function of which is still unknown.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species inhabits chiefly the rocky and treeless regions of the
  south and south-western borders of the Betsileo province of Madagascar. It is, however, not
  entirely confined to these treeless districts, for it has been recorded as occurring in bands of
  some numbers in the neighbouring forest regions.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Ring-tailed Lemur&mdash;one of the handsomest species of
  the genus and the only one in which the tail is not uniformly coloured&mdash;is of gentle manners,
  active, and graceful. According to the notes of the Rev. G. A. Shaw, as recorded in a paper in the
  Zoological Society's "Proceedings," it lives among the rocks where a few stunted trees occur, and
  over this rocky ground it can easily travel, in places where it is impossible for the natives,
  although bare-footed, to follow it. The palms of its hands and feet are smooth and leather-like,
  enabling the animal to apply them firmly to the wet rocks. This Lemur feeds on bananas and wild
  figs. In the winter its chief sustenance consists of the prickly-pear, peeling off the spiny skin
  with its long upper canines. According to the same observer, this Lemur rarely drinks water;
  indeed, it is said that the species living in the west of Madagascar, including two kinds of White
  Lemur, subsist without water, while those on the east coast invariably drink water with their
  meals. When fighting, the Ring-tailed Lemur scratches vigorously and strikes out with its
  hands.</p>

  HAPALEMUR.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Hapalemur</i>, Is. Geoffr., Cat. Méth. Primates, p. 74 (1851).</p>
  </div>

  <p>This genus has been constituted for two species of a specialised type of Lemur, characterised
  by a globose head, a short muzzle, with a tapering nose and short hairy ears. The hind-limbs are
  longer than the fore-limbs, the feet short and broad, and the tail hairy and equal in length to
  the body. The female has four teats, two on the breast, or on the shoulder, and two on the
  abdomen.</p>

  <p>In regard to their skeletal characters, the facial portion of the skull is short and narrow in
  front&mdash;the nasal bones being arched&mdash;and the brain-case rounded. The cranium presents no
  elevated frontal crests, as among the members of the next genus (<i>Lepidolemur</i>). The
  pre-maxillary bones are very small. The hind margin of the bony palate, which dilates posteriorly,
  does not extend behind the mid-line of the last molar. The squamosal region of the skull and the
  outer and posterior&mdash;the mastoidal&mdash;portion of the ear-capsules (periotic bones), is not
  inflated in the members of this genus. Their lower jaw is very characteristic, being massive in
  front and possessing a very long symphysis (or line of junction of its two halves), its angle
  being <span class="pagenum" id="page80">{80}</span>also very large, and produced downward, inward,
  and backward, even more than in the genus <i>Indris</i>. The <i>naviculare</i> bone of the ankle
  (<i>tarsus</i>) is relatively short, thus differing from the same region in <i>Microcebus</i> and
  in <i>Galago</i>; the <i>carpus</i> (or wrist) has no central (<i>os centrale</i>) bone.</p>

  <p>In <i>Hapalemur</i> the teeth are of the normal Lemurine number, viz., 36; but the dentition as
  a whole is peculiar and characteristic. Each series of teeth is very uniform and equal, and those
  anterior to the molars are serrated. In the upper jaw the incisors are very small, sub-equal, and
  situated close together; the posterior tooth on each side being (when the skull is viewed from the
  side) internal to and touching the canines. The canines are small, and the gap between them and
  the anterior pre-molar is very small. The anterior pre-molar is slightly taller vertically than
  its median fellow, and stands close up to it without an interval; it has one main (and sometimes
  one rudimentary) outer cusp; the posterior pre-molar, which closely resembles a molar, and is
  often the largest tooth in the jaw, having one inner cusp united by ridges to its two outer cusps.
  The molar teeth are sub-equal to the hindmost pre-molar, and have one front inner and two outer
  cusps, without an oblique ridge between them, and also a well-developed cingulum, cusped
  externally. Of the lower teeth, the anterior and median pre-molars are set obliquely, the median
  having three outer and two inner cusps (the two inner being united to the two hind outer by
  ridges). The posterior pre-molar is quite molariform, and, with the molars, presents three outer
  and two (or three) inner cusps, of which the two inner are united by ridges to the outer hind
  cusps, while transverse ridges unite the main outer and inner cusps together. The molars are
  cingulate towards the outside.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Fur long and soft, not woolly; ears short, hairy, with long black
  vibrissæ between them; tail bushy, and as long as the body; general shade above greyish
  Mouse-colour, washed with rufous and speckled with black on the crown, back and external surface
  of limbs; shoulders and fore-limbs bluish-grey; cheeks, throat, breast, and inner side of limbs
  ochraceous white; under side of body whitish-yellow; tail and hands grey, washed with black. Body
  and tail equal, 15 inches in length.</p>

  <p>Facial portion of skull short; brain-case rounded; lower jaw shorter and higher than in Lemurs
  generally; great toe large and broad; on the inner side of both arms close to the wrist occurs a
  rough patch (extending down to the bare skin of the palm) corresponding to a gland beneath, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page82">{82}</span>in the male, spine-like, while in the female hairy
  processes are present, together with a tuft of long hairs; external to this patch is a callous
  pad; mammæ opening on the shoulder; intestine large; cæcum small.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;Reddish-yellow below.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Grey Gentle-Lemur inhabits the eastern side of the Betsileo
  province of Madagascar.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The "Bokombouli," as the natives name this animal, is the
  smallest of any of the True Lemurs. It is nocturnal, and lives, according to the Rev. G. A. Shaw,
  among the bamboos in the higher-level forests of the island. Its lower incisors are used as
  scrapers, and nearly all its teeth are serrated and very effective in cutting off the bamboo
  shoots, on which it feeds. To enable it to grasp smooth surfaces, such as the stems of the bamboo
  and other trees it frequents, it possesses a broad pad under each great toe.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE SPORTIVE-LEMURS. GENUS
  LEPIDOLEMUR.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p><i>Lepilemur</i>, Is. Geoffr., Cat. Méth. Primates, p. 75 (1851).</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Lepidolemur</i>, Peters, M. B. Akad. Berlin, 1874, p. 690 (1874).</p>
  </div>

  <p>This genus contains, according to Dr. Forsyth Major, as many as seven species. This excellent
  comparative anatomist has made a very careful revision of the group, and the present writer has
  gratefully to acknowledge from him many valuable notes incorporated under this section, as well as
  his kindness in supplying for publication the diagnoses of his new species.</p>

  <p>Dr. Major divides these seven species into two series:&mdash;(A) a group of four larger
  species, and (B) a group of three smaller species.</p>

  <p>The members of this genus are smaller than the True Lemurs of the genus <i>Lemur</i>. Their
  head is conical and short, their ears large, round, and membranaceous, and the tail is shorter
  than the body. In this latter character and in their shorter limbs they differ from
  <i>Mixocebus</i>. The fourth finger and toe are the longest digits of their respective
  extremities, the nails of all are keeled, and that of the great toe is very large and flat.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page84">{84}</span></div>

  <p>In the skull, the muzzle is longer than the longitudinal diameter of its orbit in the series of
  larger species (Section A); in the smaller species (Section B) the muzzle is shorter.</p>

  <p>Their dentition presents several important characters. The series of upper molars and
  pre-molars form almost a straight line, both sides being almost parallel, or only slightly
  convergent towards the front. In the upper jaw the incisors are wanting; the canines are very
  large and grooved internally, and have a posterior heel. There is no gap between them and the
  anterior pre-molar, which last is vertically taller than the rest, and has one cusp to the
  outside, whereas the median and posterior have an inner cusp as well. The anterior and median
  molars have the inner hind cusp rudimentary, but the cingulum rises into a minute cusp, both at
  the fore and hind edge; the posterior molar is three-cusped. The whole of the cheek-teeth
  gradually broaden and decrease in vertical height from before backward as far as the median molar.
  In the lower jaw the anterior pre-molars are large, canine-like, and decumbent, and have a strong
  process on their anterior margin (resembling that in the corresponding tooth in <i>Indris</i>);
  the median and posterior pre-molars have one external cusp, and the latter tooth one interior cusp
  in addition. The anterior and median molars have a rudimentary fifth cusp, which is large in the
  posterior molar.</p>

  <p>The pre-maxillæ are very much reduced, so that the teeth they usually carry are generally
  wanting. The bony palate is short, its hind margin extending back only to the middle of the median
  molar; its anterior foramina are small; and it differs from that of <i>Microcebus</i> and
  <i>Chirogale</i> in having its posterior perforations small. The angle of the lower jaw is
  produced downwards and backwards. The mastoid portion of the ear-capsules (periotic bones) as well
  as the squamosal are markedly <span class="pagenum" id="page85">{85}</span>enlarged and swollen,
  in this respect differing from the skulls of <i>Lemur</i> and <i>Hapalemur</i>. The ridges in the
  temporal bone unite into a frontal (sagittal) ridge, and the space between the orbits is
  depressed; a depression is also present on the cheek in front of the lachrymal foramen. The foot
  is slightly elongated by the lengthening of the <i>naviculare</i> bone of the ankle
  (<i>tarsus</i>), the thin bones of which are short. In the wrist (<i>carpus</i>) there is no <i>os
  centrale</i> or central bone, which is otherwise invariably present in the Primates, except in
  Man, the Chimpanzees, the Gentle-Lemurs, and the Endrina.</p>

  <p>The Sportive-Lemurs are confined to Madagascar and are nocturnal and arboreal creatures,
  feeding on leaves and fruits.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In Group A (the larger species) are included: 1, The Weasel-like Lemur (<i>L.
  mustelinus</i>); 2, the Red-tailed Sportive-Lemur (<i>L. ruficaudatus</i>); 3, Edwards'
  Sportive-Lemur (<i>L. edwardsi</i>); and 4, the Small-toothed Sportive-Lemur (<i>L. microdon</i>).
  Group B (consisting of the smaller species) comprises: 1, The Round-headed Sportive-Lemur (<i>L.
  globiceps</i>); 2, Grandidier's Sportive-Lemur (<i>L. grandidieri</i>); and 3, the White-footed
  Sportive-Lemur (<i>L. leucopus</i>). With the exception of the two first-named species, all the
  others are here made known for the first time by Dr. Forsyth Major. Very little is recorded of the
  habits of these animals. They are so rare that at present the various species are known from a few
  skins or alcoholic specimens in European museums. They are said to be inhabitants only of the
  forest-country, nocturnal in their habits, sleeping coiled up in some retreat all day, but issuing
  forth at night, at which time they are very agile in their movements.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE ENDRINAS. SUB-FAMILY INDRISINÆ.</p>

  <p>This, the last sub-family of the <i>Lemuridæ</i>, is considered to contain the highest members
  of the whole Sub-order. They are distinguished by having their fur abundant, longer and woolly
  above, shorter beneath, with the hands and feet haired to the tips of the digits. Their head, set
  at right angles to the spinal column, is rounded, the face elongated and naked, with a deep furrow
  separating the nostrils. The eyes are large, and have a third eyelid, or nictitating membrane, to
  draw across the pupil during the day. The ears, which are naked inside and fringed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page91">{91}</span>on the outside, are moderately long and buried in the fur,
  but are less movable at will than is the case with the Galagos. Their fore-limbs are much shorter
  than the hind ones. The arms, which are united to the body by a parachute-like fold of integument,
  have long, narrow, and strong hands, of which the thumb is short, set far back, and but little
  opposable. The rest of the fingers, except the index, which is short, are long and slender, and
  terminate in a round disc. The feet are elongate, and the great toe, which is freely opposable to
  the other toes, is very large and broad, being, indeed, nearly as wide as the rest of the digits
  together; the remaining toes are united by a membrane as far as the second segment. The females
  have the mammæ situated on the breast.</p>

  <p>In the skull the facial region is relatively small, and the cranial region relatively large.
  The external nostrils communicate with a cavity on the underlying bone; the pre-maxillary bones
  are deeply excavated in front, and the anterior perforations in the bony palate, behind the
  incisor teeth, are large. The lower jaw has its angle large, produced backwards, the line of union
  of its two halves being long, and its lateral movements very limited. In regard to their
  dentition, the number of the milk-teeth in the young individual is greater than that of the
  permanent set in the adult, the formula of the former being I<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span> [M<span class="ifrac"><span

  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, the lower canine
  and one lower pre-molar having disappeared. In the upper jaw the incisors are very small, the
  outer one standing behind the inner one, with a space between the former and the canine; the
  canines are long, curved behind, and set close up to the anterior pre-molar. The pre-molars are
  longer than they are broad, laterally compressed, and present to the outside one main triangular
  cusp with a small accessory cusp on each <span class="pagenum" id="page92">{92}</span>side, the
  posterior tooth of the series having a hind inner cusp. The anterior and median molars are
  four-cusped, of which the outer and inner pairs are separated by a longitudinal groove; to the
  outside they have one supernumerary cusp on each main cusp, and one between them. The median molar
  is the largest tooth of the jaw, and the posterior is small, triangular and three-cusped. Of the
  lower jaw, the outer pair of the long, and almost horizontally protruding incisors, is larger than
  the inner pair, and is separated by a space from the anterior pre-molar. Of the elongate laterally
  compressed pre-molars, the anterior is the larger, and is vertically taller than its fellows,
  being slightly depressed forward and curved behind; the posterior pre-molar has one cusp. The
  molars have four cusps, of which the inner ones alternate with the outer cusps.</p>

  <p>The intestinal canal in the <i>Indrisinæ</i> is very long, the cæcum, or blind diverticulum at
  the junction of its two portions, being extremely long and large, occupying, indeed, a great part
  of the abdominal cavity. The main arteries of the fore- and hind-limbs do not break up into a
  <i>rete mirabile</i>, or series of small parallel vessels, as in many other Lemuroids.</p>

  <p>In this group, while the sense of smell is very perfect, that of hearing is less acute than in
  the other Sub-families; and that of touch conspicuously blunt, both in the fingers and toes, which
  are chiefly climbing and not tactile and prehensile organs, as they are in the corresponding limbs
  of the Anthropoids. The female never produces more than one young at a birth.</p>

  <p>The convolutions of the brain are few, but they are more complicated than in many of the South
  American Monkeys. In very young individuals the cerebellum is more covered by the cerebrum than it
  is in the adult.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span></div>

  <p>The species of this Sub-family are confined to the island of Madagascar. Our knowledge of their
  general characters, anatomical structure and habits, is very complete, through the researches,
  both in the field, of M. Grandidier, and in the study, of Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards. These
  results are published in their magnificent "Histoire de Madagascar," to which the reader is
  referred for fuller information.</p>

  <p>The <i>Indrisinæ</i>, on account of their superior organisation, and especially their
  relatively large brain, are considered to be the highest of all the Lemuroids. They are
  essentially arboreal. If they come to the ground they sit upright on their hind-legs, and progress
  by jumps, holding their arms above their heads. They are easily tamed, and become gentle in
  confinement; but they are not very intelligent. The Endrinas "never manifest in any very marked
  manner," so MM. Milne-Edwards and Grandidier tell us, "the passions that affect the Apes so
  vividly; their countenance, almost as immobile as that of an herbivorous or carnivorous animal,
  exhibits neither anger nor pleasure. In captivity they do not seek to be caressed; they appear
  neither to become attached to their master, nor to take interest in anything about them." Many of
  their actions, however, and the peculiar sounds they often utter, recall those of Monkeys.</p>

  <p>Some of the species are diurnal and others nocturnal.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Sub-family has been divided into three genera, <i>Avahis</i> with one species;
  <i>Propithecus</i>, with three species, and <i>Indris</i> with a single species. All its members
  are remarkable for the extraordinary amount of variation in the coloration of their fur.</p>

  <p>Cranium more vaulted and the muzzle remarkably shorter than in the genera <i>Indris</i> and
  <i>Propithecus</i>; eye-sockets very large; the space between the eyes hollow. Temporal ridges not
  uniting into a single median ridge. Nasal bones projecting as far as the front end of the very
  small pre-maxillary bone. Lower jaw remarkably deep and broad behind; line of union of its two
  halves nearly half the length of the jaw, and in a straight line with the incisor teeth. Toothless
  space in front of upper jaw greater than in the other two genera. Dentition of the upper jaw:
  <i>incisors</i> small, the outer larger than the inner, set close to the canines and not at the
  inner edge of the toothless space; <i>canines</i> vertically short; <i>pre-molars</i>, with no
  inner cusp, but having a prominent outer cingulum (a character seen in no other species of Lemur);
  <i>molars</i>, four-cusped. Lower jaw: <i>incisors</i> larger than in the two other genera, and
  less horizontal, the inner ones more slender than the outer. Anterior and posterior <i>molars</i>,
  five-cusped. Hind margin of palate reaching to the middle of the median molar. Central bone of
  wrist wanting (of all Primates agreeing in this character only with Man, the Chimpanzees, the
  Gentle- and Sportive-Lemurs and the Endrina); fourth digit of the hands and feet longest. Tail
  long. The small intestine not spirally coiled upon itself, but folded many times transversely.</p>

  <p>Hair long, woolly, dark Mouse-grey at base, reddish-brown in the middle, black at the tips.
  Face broad, entirely covered with short greyish-brown hairs; nose-pad alone nude. Ears concealed
  and covered by rufous hair; pupil of eye very contractile, very narrow and linear during the day;
  across the forehead and over the eyes a transverse lunulate whitish band, margined anteriorly by a
  black band. Back greyish-brown, the nape darker; a patch over the rump, and the base of the tail
  and buttocks white, washed with rufous; back and inner side of thighs and round the arms whitish;
  a narrow fringe on the lower margin of arms and legs ashy-grey, washed with rufous; fore-arm,
  hands and feet rusty-brown; tail bright dark red, deepest at its extremity. Under side and inner
  surface of limbs grey, washed with rufous. Length of body, 12½ inches; tail, 15¾ inches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page96">{96}</span></div>

  <p>Of this species there are two forms, an <i>eastern</i> and a <i>northern</i>, the latter being
  always smaller in size, with the fur lighter and less rusty. In some varieties the upper surface
  is dark rusty-red all over, and the inner sides of the limbs pure white. Examples from the
  north-west coast are constantly smaller; the head rounder, and the facial hairs grey; no white
  band on the forehead; upper surface bright yellowish-brown; tail rusty-grey; under side of
  hind-limbs pure white, the under surface and inner side of the arms whitish. The variation in
  coloration is due to the middle part of the hairs, which in typical specimens is rusty-red, but is
  yellow in the above-mentioned form. Hands and feet grey.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;Ashy-grey, slightly washed with red.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Woolly Avahi seems to inhabit only the forests of the parallel
  ranges of the mountains which face the whole eastern coast of Madagascar; it extends round the bay
  of Passandava on the west coast, opposite to the northern termination of this eastern range of
  mountains.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This species&mdash;the smallest of the
  <i>Indrisinæ</i>&mdash;being essentially nocturnal, is torpid during the day, and is the wildest
  and least docile of the family. The first specimen of the "Avahi," the name by which this animal
  is known among the Anatala tribe, was brought to Europe by Sonnerat, the French traveller, in
  1781, and nearly half a century elapsed before a second one was obtained. Since then several
  specimens have been kept in captivity in the different zoological gardens of Europe.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page97">{97}</span></div>

  <p>The characters which distinguish this genus from <i>Avahis</i> and <i>Indris</i> are the
  following: The fur with which they are covered is more silky than woolly, and in general
  appearance is white, more or less washed with yellow, varying to red or black. The head is very
  slightly longer than it is broad, with a black and almost naked muzzle; the ears, half buried in
  the fur, are flatter and wider than in <i>Indris</i>, the inner surface being naked and black, and
  the outer haired. The nostrils are large and semilunar in shape. The tail is long. The
  index-finger is not united by a membrane to the others; their hands and feet are in a much less
  degree organs of prehension than in most of the other Lemurs.</p>

  <p>The skull in proportionate length is intermediate between that of <i>Avahis</i> and
  <i>Indris</i>. Compared with <i>Avahis</i> it is less vaulted, its muzzle is longer, and the
  orbits are smaller. The space between the eyes is high, and not depressed, on account of the
  presence of a large air-cavity in the underlying bone. Their nasal bones do not reach as far
  forward in front as the level of the incisor teeth. In the dentition of the upper jaw, the
  incisors protrude somewhat in front, and are dilated laterally in a regular series&mdash;thus
  distinguishing the genus <i>Propithecus</i> from <i>Lemur</i>,&mdash;the inner incisors being
  larger than the outer ones, with their tips approximating. Between the canine and the anterior
  pre-molar there is a short gap. The anterior and median molars have the cusps of the crown
  alternate; the posterior has them opposite. In the lower jaw the incisors are shorter and stronger
  than in <i>Avahis</i>, and the molars are four-cusped.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Propithecus</i> contains three species; (1) The Diademed Sifaka (<i>P.
  diadema</i>), (2) Verreaux's Sifaka (<i>P. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page98">{98}</span>verreauxi</i>), both having numerous very marked varieties; and (3) the
  Crowned Sifaka (<i>P. coronatus</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">These species are found all round the coasts of Madagascar; as well in the
  luxuriant forests on the east side as in the arid deserts and the sparsely-wooded plains of the
  south-western and western coasts. Of the three species of the genus, one (<i>P. diadema</i>) is
  confined to the eastern and southern coasts, the other two (<i>P. verreauxi</i> and <i>P.
  coronatus</i>) are found only on the west coast. More or less distinctly coloured varieties or
  races of these three species occur, and it is very remarkable that each of them is rigorously
  restricted to localities distinct from that of the typical species.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Fur long, silky, the muzzle naked. Head shorter and rounder than in
  the other species of the genus; thumb slender, like the toes, set far back, free; great toe very
  strong, and in the same plane with the other digits; a marked depression exists in the skull
  behind the orbits. Body, 21 inches; tail, 19 inches in length.</p>

  <p>Forehead crossed by a broad white bar; cheeks in front of the ears, and the under side of the
  chin, white or fulvous white; face black, with a few short black hairs. Back of head, neck,
  shoulders, sides of body, outer sides of arms, sometimes grey, but generally very dark brown,
  merging into dark grey on the lower back. Tail at its root washed with orange-yellow, paler in the
  middle, greyish-white at its extremity. Fore-arm, lower part of arm, sacral region, and external
  face of hind-limbs, bright <span class="pagenum" id="page99">{99}</span>orange-yellow. Hands
  black-haired to the ends of the fingers, but with long and yellow tufts of hair at the tips. Feet
  pale orange and haired to the nails. Chest dark brown. Under surface white, or white tinged with
  yellow, or dark brownish-grey. Internal face of the fore-limbs grey, from the intermixture of
  black hairs; that of the hind-limbs pale yellow.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;Similar in colour to the adults, but lighter; the frontal band yellow, not
  white; limbs light yellow.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Varieties.</b>&mdash;Several varieties of this species&mdash;the "Simpona" of
  the natives&mdash;have been described, of which the following deserve special notice<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE SILKY SIFAKA. PROPITHECUS
  SERICEUS.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">Face black, with flesh-coloured spots; the body entirely white, faintly washed with
  yellow; the base of the tail washed with rust-red. It is of the same size as the type-form, and
  appears to be only an albino variety. Specimens showing every gradation in coloration between that
  of the type and the absolute albino are now well known. This form, however, is more or less
  restricted to the narrow belts of forest on the eastern side of the mountains in the north-east of
  Madagascar, between the rivers Lokoi and Bemarivo, a region conterminous with that inhabited by
  the typical species.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;"><span class="x-smaller">MILNE-EDWARDS' SIFAKA.
  PROPITHECUS EDWARDSI.</span></p>

  <p>Differs from the true <i>P. diadema</i> in having the face slightly haired between the eyes and
  on the chin; a patch on each flank rufous-white or orange-yellow, separated by a reddish-black
  band; a spot at the root of the tail bright rusty-red, and all the rest of body black, washed
  slightly with rufous. The young are like the parents. This form is also of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page100">{100}</span>same size as the type, but is a melanistic variety, for a
  series of specimens show every intermediate shade between that here described and the <span
  class="sc">Black Sifaka</span> (<i>P. holomelas</i>), which is of an entirely black colour, and
  inhabits, as has been shown by MM. Milne-Edwards and Grandidier, the same region as <i>P.
  edwardsi</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The typical form of the species is confined to the
  extended region on the east coast of Madagascar lying between the Bay of Antongil on the north,
  and the River Masora in the south, in the forest-belts on the eastern aspect of the mountains,
  where rain falls abundantly and the whole region is covered with luxuriant vegetation. Its
  melanistic variety (<i>P. edwardsi</i>) extends south from the Masora as far as the Faraouny
  river, but it ranges to higher and colder altitudes on the mountains; while its albinistic variety
  (<i>P. sericeus</i>) lives in the somewhat warmer region to the north of Antongil Bay, each being,
  to south and north respectively, conterminous with the central habitat of the typical form.</p>

  of body, 18 inches; of tail, 22 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;Entirely white, with a dark brown spot on the head; the under surface of

  <p class="sp3"><b>Varieties.</b>&mdash;Two well-marked varieties of this species are known, both
  of which were for many years considered to be distinct species. Continued exploration has,
  however, now resulted in the accumulation in various museums of a large amount of material from
  many localities, and this proves that the two forms really belong to but one species.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;"><span class="x-smaller">VON DER DECKEN'S SIFAKA.

  <p class="sp3">Differs from the true <i>P. verreauxi</i> in having the face and ears black, and
  the body otherwise entirely grey, or white, washed more or less with yellow (sometimes rufous on
  the limbs); or of an ashy-grey colour on the loins, neck, and outer aspect of the limbs; the under
  side bright rufous; chest and inner sides of the limbs rusty-white, with a fulvous spot at the
  base of the tail. Specimens from the forests of the interior have a grey spot on the back of the
  neck expanding into a collar, which is absent in those from the coast. An albino variety comes, so
  far as is at present known, only from the wooded belts on the extensive plains between the rivers
  Manambolo and Manjaray, on the west coast.</p>

  <p class="ac">(<i>Plate XI.</i>)</p>

  <p>Has the face naked and black, but the centre of the nose white; the ears showing as black
  points amid the white hair; head and back of neck white, slightly washed with yellow; outer side
  of arm and fore-arm dark maroon-red, the lower border fringed with long white hair; a maroon patch
  on the upper and outer surface of the thighs, lighter on the chest and central part of the belly.
  Loins dark rusty-grey; hands white; tail rusty-grey.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Verreaux's Sifaka, with its two varieties, is confined to the small
  thin woods on the sandy and almost rain-less plains along the western and southern coasts of
  Madagascar. The type-form is found, alone, and unassociated, in the extensive plains of Mesozoic
  geological formation&mdash;between the southern base of the eastern range of mountains and the
  River Tsidsubon, which flows into the sea on the west coast. Von der Decken's Sifaka inhabits the
  middle of the west coast, while Coquerel's Sifaka has its home further to the north. It occupies
  the area between the south side of Narendry Bay and the north side of Bembatoka Bay, the Betsiboka
  River being its extreme southern limit.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Though first observed by Flacourt, and described by him in 1661, Verreaux's Sifaka
  remained practically unknown from that time till re-discovered by M. Grandidier in 1867.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Muzzle very broad and naked; nose-pad wide; inside of ears naked.
  Face, top of head, sides of neck, and throat, deep brownish-black; muzzle black; a band across the
  temples, and a streak down the nose, white. Ears black inside, fringed externally with white; neck
  and upper surface white, washed with rust-colour on the limbs and root of the tail. Tail, hands,
  and feet, pure white. Under side rich orange-red, darker across the chest; inside of limbs white,
  washed with rufous. Of the same size as <i>P. verreauxi</i>.</p>

  <p>Cranium larger in all its parts than in other species. Nasal bones elongated beyond the incisor
  teeth; nose very flat, this being due to the large air-cavity (called false nose) in the jaw-bone
  below, connected with the nose. The length and breadth of the muzzle gives a peculiar expression
  to the face of <i>P. coronatus</i>.</p>

  <p>This species, like the preceding, is subject to considerable variation.</p>

  <p>The whole head is sometimes grey, washed with rufous; the upper surface and root of the tail
  white, flushed with rust-colour.</p>

  <p>In examples living further in the interior than the habitat of the type (Bay of Bembatoka), the
  back is more rufous, the neck has a large grey or brown patch, and the chest is very dark brownish
  rust-colour. The abdomen and the inner sides of the limbs are bright red.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species occurs on the north-west coast of Madagascar, between
  the Bay of Mozamba to the north and the River Manjaray on the south, ranging over the country to a
  considerable distance into the interior. The lighter-coloured specimens come from the more
  northern range of the species, while the more brightly-marked varieties have been obtained <span
  class="pagenum" id="page104">{104}</span>in the interior more to the south. It is curious, remarks
  M. Grandidier, to find races and species of the same genus so exactly restricted, that one has
  only to cross a river, not necessarily large, in order to obtain on one bank certain species of
  <i>Propithecus</i>, whereas those occurring on the opposite bank may be of a very distinct species
  or race. To what influence in their surroundings can all these variations be ascribed? One can
  understand that species inhabiting a wooded and humid country, or living among granitic mountains
  (as <i>P. diadema</i> does), would differ in size and fur from other members of the same genus
  which live in dry and arid plains (as in the case of <i>P. verreauxi</i>); but how can the great
  variations that occur in members of the same species living a few miles, and perhaps only a few
  metres, apart, be explained, when the external conditions are almost the same?</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The habits of the different species of Sifaka are very similar. They live
  in companies of six or eight, and are very gentle and inoffensive animals, wearing always a most
  melancholy expression, and, as a rule, being morose, inactive, and more silent than other Lemurs.
  They rarely live long in captivity. In their native state they are most alert in the morning and
  evening, as during the heat of the day they conceal themselves amid the foliage of the trees. When
  asleep or in repose, the head is dropped on the chest and buried between the arms, the tail rolled
  up on itself and disposed between the hind-legs. The Sifakas live exclusively on vegetable
  substances&mdash;leaves, fruits and flowers&mdash;their diet not being varied, as in the other
  groups, by small birds, eggs, or insects. Their life is almost entirely arboreal, for which the
  muscles of their hands and feet, as well as the parachute-like fold of skin between their arms and
  body, and their peculiarly hook-like fingers, are most fitted. The young one is carried about by
  its mother on her back, its hands grasping her arm-pits tightly. The Sifakas are held in great
  veneration or fear by the natives of Madagascar, and are never intentionally killed by them.</p>

  <p>All stages between the forms here described and complete <span class="pagenum"
  id="page108">{108}</span>albinos are known; so that the various differences observed prove them to
  be only individual variations of the same species.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Endrina is confined to the woods looking eastward, on the two
  high ranges along the eastern coast, between the Bay of Antongil on the north and the River Masora
  on the south.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The "Endrina," "Bàbakòto," or "Amboanala" (Dog of the Forest), as the
  natives variously name this species, has the same habits as the Sifakas. It is the largest of the
  Lemurs, and is diurnal. It derives its appellation of "Dog of the Forest" from the doleful,
  dog-like howls which it utters. In this habit it differs, therefore, from most of the other groups
  (except the True Lemurs), which are, as a rule, rather silent. Its powerful voice is due to the
  distensible resonator which it possesses in its laryngeal pouch, described above. Essentially
  diurnal, the Endrinas live in small companies, and feed only on vegetable diet. The hook-like
  fingers of their hands are better adapted for climbing than for prehension, and much of their food
  is, indeed, seized by the mouth. They are entirely arboreal, and move about the trees in an erect
  position, rarely coming to the ground. The "Bàbakòto" is held in great veneration by most of the
  native tribes.</p>

  <p>M. Pollen gives several other particulars of these Lemurs, and of the curious notions of the
  Malagasy respecting them. Their native name is "Bàbakòto," literally "Father-child" (or "boy"),
  not "Indri," as stated by Sonnerat, who discovered the species. <i>Indri</i>, or <i>Indry</i>, is
  a Malagasy word meaning "lo!" or "behold!" and was probably mistaken by him and other Europeans
  for the vernacular name of the animal when the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page109">{109}</span>natives exclaimed, "Indry izy!" ("There he is!"). Dr. A. Vinson says
  that, in passing through the great Eastern forest, he was assailed for two days by the incessant
  clamour of these Lemurs, which seem to keep together in large companies, but are invisible in the
  dense foliage. The natives have a superstitious veneration for these animals, and consider them as
  sacred. They believe that their ancestors change after death into <i>Bàbakòto</i>, and that the
  trees where these animals live supply infallible remedies against otherwise incurable diseases.
  The people say that it is very dangerous to kill these Lemurs with spears, because if a spear is
  hurled against one of them it seizes the spear in its flight without being itself hurt, and in its
  turn stabs with certain aim those attacking it. They also relate that when the female has borne a
  young one, she takes the little creature in her arms and tosses it to her mate, who is seated on a
  neighbouring tree, and that he throws it back to the female. If the little one does not fall to
  the ground after being subjected to this exercise for a dozen times, the parents bring it up with
  the greatest care; but, if the contrary event happens, they abandon it, not even troubling to pick
  it up. In certain parts of Madagascar, says M. Pollen, the people employ the <i>Bàbakòto</i> in
  chasing birds, and they say that it renders as good service as a Dog. These animals, although
  principally fruit-eaters, do not disdain small birds, which they catch with much skill, in order
  to eat their brains.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This Lemuroid is probably the best known to travellers in Madagascar, at least by
  ear, as no one can travel along the most frequented route in the island, that from Tamatave to
  Antananarivo, without often hearing the cries of these animals as he passes through the great
  forest. They are not often seen, but their long drawn-out melancholy cries are frequently heard, a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page110">{110}</span>strange wailing sound, as if of people in distress,
  or children crying. Dr. Vinson says that the Bètànimèna tribe let these animals at liberty if they
  find them in captivity, and give them burial should they find them dead. They relate that a
  certain tribe, at war with its neighbours, took refuge in the forests; their enemies, in pursuing
  them, led by the sound of human voices, as they supposed, found before them a troop of
  <i>Bàbakòto</i>, at whose appearance they were struck with terror. They fled, persuaded that the
  fugitives had been changed into beasts. These, on the other hand, vowed eternal gratitude to the
  Lemurs who had saved them, and have ever since religiously refrained from injuring them in any
  way.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;"><b>EXTINCT LEMUROIDEA.</b></p>

  <p>On a former page (<i>anteà</i>, p. <a href="#page13">13</a>), attention was drawn to the
  interrupted distribution of the Lemurs, and to their present restricted range to the tropical and
  sub-tropical regions of Africa, of Madagascar, and of part of the mainland and of the islands of
  the Asiatic continent. In times geologically not very remote, they were inhabitants of both
  worlds.</p>

  <p>The earliest appearance of the Primates in time is at the beginning of the Tertiary period.
  Lemuroids, some of them of a more or less primitive type, then lived in Europe in the Lower Eocene
  period. In the higher beds of the same epoch (to which the fresh-water deposits of the London clay
  of England, the Plastic clay of France, and the prolific Wasatch beds of Wyoming, Utah, and
  Colorado of America belong) undoubted Lemurs are represented by many genera, which in the Middle
  Eocene attained to a great development.</p>

  <p>In the Upper Eocene of Europe many distinctively <span class="pagenum"
  id="page111">{111}</span>Lemuroid genera (<i>Adapis</i>, <i>Microchærus</i>, &amp;c.) "formed," as
  Zittel remarks, "a very characteristic element of the fauna; they are connected with old Tertiary
  fore-runners, and combine features of the existing Lemurs and true Apes." The presence of these
  heat-loving animals in such northern latitudes undoubtedly indicates the existence there of a
  climate more genial at that epoch than now. In the corresponding period in North America remains
  have been less plentifully found; but for the most part the genera are representatives of those of
  the European beds.</p>

  <p>In strata of Oligocene and older Miocene age no Lemuroid remains have come to light in Europe,
  and they are represented by only one or two doubtful forms in America. After that date they
  apparently vanished from the New World and from the northern portions of the Old.</p>

  <p>Many of these extinct Lemuroids so combine the characters of the <i>Insectivora</i> and the
  <i>Ungulata</i> (or hoofed animals), with those of their own Sub-order, that it is often extremely
  difficult, even impossible, sometimes, to determine to which Order they really belong, owing to a
  blending of characters due to their common origin. The Upper Eocene forms present many affinities
  with the South American Capuchin Monkeys (<i>Cebidæ</i>). Dr. Forsyth Major is of opinion,
  however, that they are more highly, and not (as is generally believed) less specialised than those
  now living, which appear to have been the subject of retrogressive development.</p>

  <p>The species to be noticed below are some of the more important of those which have been
  ascertained to belong to the present Sub-order.</p>

  <p class="sp5">No remains assignable with certainty to the families <i>Chiromyidæ</i> or
  <i>Tarsiidæ</i>, have as yet been discovered. The first form <span class="pagenum"
  id="page112">{112}</span>to be mentioned belongs to a family which has now no living
  representatives.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">FAMILY MEGALADAPIDÆ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This family has recently been established by Dr. Forsyth Major, for a fossil
  species represented by the greater portion of a large cranium and part of its lower jaw, found in
  a marsh at Amboulisatra, on the south-west coast of Madagascar. This species is the only
  representative of the single genus of the family.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">GENUS MEGALADAPIS.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Megaladapis</i>, Forsyth Major, Phil. Trans., vol. 185 B, p. 15 (1894).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The cranium, about 10 inches long, indicates an aged animal three or four times as long as the
  common Cat, which is an enormous size as compared with any living Lemur. Brain-case straight,
  narrow, short, low, and situated at a higher level than the facial region; an enormous lateral
  development of the region between the eyes; orbits small in diameter, communicating freely with
  the temporal fossa, protruding outwards and forwards, and surrounded by a thickened ring; facial
  region elongate and bent upward; palate convex downwards from front to back; ridges for attachment
  of the temporal muscles uniting in a great central crest; frontal bones constricted behind the
  orbits; maxillary bones behind the molar teeth greatly inflated by air-cavities; the two halves of
  the lower jaw ossified together. In the upper jaw the pre-molars have one outer and one inner
  cusp, and the molars one internal and two external cusps, the former being deeply separated from
  the hind outer cusp, and joined by a ridge to the front outer cusp. In the lower <span
  class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>jaw, the posterior pre-molar has one outer cusp, a fore
  and hind inner cusp (each joined by a crescent to the outer cusp), and a central inner cusp; the
  three molars have two outer and three alternating inner cusps, and to the outer side a basal
  cingulum; the posterior molar has a strongly cusped heel.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Megaladapis madagascariensis</span>, Forsyth Major, the only species of the
  genus, presents many marsupial and insectivorous characters and features which show some approach
  towards the South-American Howlers (<i>Alouatta</i>), a specialisation "not in the least,"
  according to Dr. Major, "implying a near relationship, but probably only an adaptation to a
  corresponding function" implied in the "vocal organs of unusual size," which, he believes,
  <i>Megaladapis</i> to have possessed. Lemurine characters, however, predominate. In the shape of
  its molars it is related to <i>Lepidolemur</i>, and still more closely to <i>Microcebus</i> and
  <i>Chirogale</i>, while by the characters of its inter-orbital region it approaches to the Sifakas
  (<i>Propithecus</i>) and the extinct <i>Adapis</i>.</p>

  <p>The small diameter of its orbits suggests, according to Dr. Major, that in habits this extinct
  giant Lemur was diurnal; and from the conformation of its lower jaw "there exists," continues the
  same distinguished investigator, "a strong assumption that, as in <i>Alouatta</i>, it was provided
  with vocal organs of unusual size."</p>

  <p class="sp5">The age of this Howling Lemur, estimated either geologically or by years, cannot be
  of very great antiquity. Its remains were found associated with those of the giant Moa-like bird,
  the <i>Æpyornis</i>, of Tortoises and Hippopotami, all now extinct, and of Crocodiles still living
  in the interior lakes of the island. Some of these animals were certainly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page114">{114}</span>contemporaneous with the now vanished Dodo and the large flightless Rail
  (<i>Aphanapteryx</i>), both of which were seen alive by Europeans little more than two centuries
  ago, and it is not improbable that Megaladapis may have been living in the Madagascar forests at
  the same period.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">FAMILY LEMURIDÆ (<i>anteà</i>, p. <a
  href="#page22">22</a>).</p>

  <p class="sp5">In this family, and in its sub-family <i>Lemurinæ</i> (because of its affinities
  with <i>Hapalemur</i>), has to be included a large extinct species from Nossi Vey, in North-west
  Madagascar. Its fossil remains were recently described (P. Z. S., 1893, p. 532), but not named by
  Dr. Forsyth Major. They will prove, he believes, when more fully known, to be the type of a new
  genus. At present, however, owing to their incomplete state, it is not possible to describe the
  species fully. "The Lemuroid nature of the specimen is at once demonstrated by the great elevation
  and downward bending of the post-orbital processes ... showing that the osseous ring of the orbit
  was complete." Unusual for a Lemuroid is the very strong post-orbital constriction of the
  frontals, a character, however, seen in <i>Adapis</i>, an Eocene European form, and in
  <i>Hapalemur</i>. With the latter it agrees in the voluminous cranial and very short facial
  portion, and the "cuttingly sharp" inferior margin of its post-orbital process. Seen from the
  side, this fossil cranium is almost vertically truncated behind, as in the skull of
  <i>Alouatta</i>. The region between the eyes is vaulted by underlying air-chambers.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">FAMILY ANAPTOMORPHIDÆ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This family includes certain fossil forms of Lower Eocene age from the phosphatic
  deposits of Quercy in France, the <span class="pagenum" id="page115">{115}</span>Wasatch strata of
  Wyoming, and the Puerco beds in New Mexico. Their dental formula is the same as that of existing
  Lemurs, namely I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span

  class="ifracd">(2-3)</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span
  class="ifracd">3</span></span>. In some of the genera there is a tendency to develop, as Cope has
  pointed out, large cutting teeth in the position of incisors, "thus approaching the Aye-Aye." The
  posterior pre-molars are more simple than the anterior true molar, a character which indicates
  some relationship to the Mouse-Lemurs (<i>Chirogale</i>). The mastoidal or posterior portion of
  the ear-capsules, and the neighbouring squamosal region of the cranium are swollen, as among the
  Galagos.</p>

  <p>This genus is distinguished from all other Lemurs by "the angle of the mandible being produced
  into a large hook-like flange." (Flower and Lydekker.) The orbits are large, indicating a
  nocturnal animal; the inter-orbital space is wide, and distinguishes it from <i>Loris</i>. The
  dental formula is I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span

  <p class="sp3">This genus is represented by five species. <span class="sc">Microchærus

  have three cusps in front and a heel behind. The dental characters of the genus "resemble

  <p>This genus was founded by Cope on an almost entire cranium discovered in the Bridger (Eocene)
  beds of the upper Valley of Green river, and on other remains from what is known as the Wasatch
  formation of the Big-Horn Basin in Wyoming Territory, in North America. The external upper incisor
  is small and set close to the small canine; the pre-molars have each a large external and a
  smaller internal cusp; the true molars are wide and have one internal and two external cusps. In
  the lower jaw the two anterior molars are four-cusped, with a transverse ridge between the
  anterior pair, and an oblique ridge between the hind inner, and the front outer, cusp; the
  posterior is three-cusped and has a heel. The orbits are enclosed, as in typical Lemurs. Not less
  typical characters are the position of the lachrymal foramen, external to the orbit, and the
  unossified halves of the lower jaw. "Its dental formula (I<span class="ifrac"><span

  <p>"The general form of the cranium," to quote Sir W. Flower, "the large size and anterior
  direction of the orbits, the small and narrow muzzle ... show its affinity to the Lemurine
  animals, and especially to the African forms. The whole skull, however, is more depressed than in
  the slow Lemurs and Galagos; the orbits are smaller, the brain cavity relatively smaller and more
  constricted behind the orbits, and the muscular ridges more developed."... The lower jaw is deep
  and stout. The posterior upper pre-molar is very similar to a true molar. "The upper molar teeth
  are nearly equal in size, and have nearly square crowns, with four distinct cusps, one at each
  angle, rather obliquely placed"; the hind inner cusp <span class="pagenum"
  id="page120">{120}</span>of the posterior molar inconspicuous. The lower molars have two pairs of
  obliquely placed cusps, connected by transverse ridges, anterior and posterior, with an oblique
  ridge running forwards and inwards from the outer hind cusp. The hindmost lower pre-molar has an
  internal cusp; the lower incisors have upright spatulate crowns like those of true Apes.</p>

  their heel presenting a cusp at its inner hind angle (except in <i>H. acolytus</i>). Of the upper

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;"><b>II. THE MONKEYS AND APES&mdash;SUB-ORDER
  ANTHROPOIDEA.</b></p>

  <p>This Sub-order, though containing animals of much higher organisation than the
  <i>Lemuroidea</i>, embraces species presenting many different grades of intelligence, and ranging
  in size from the Pigmy Marmoset, not larger than a small Kitten, to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page124">{124}</span>ponderous Gorilla and the genus <i>Homo</i>. In external characters the
  Monkeys and Apes have in general a shorter and less Dog-like nose than the Lemurs, thin lips and a
  more distinct face; while their eyes, situated on the face, are invariably directed forwards, and
  never outwards, or to the side. The opening of their nostrils is either outward (as in those
  inhabiting the New World), or downwards (as in the bulk of the Old World species). All of them are
  covered with hair; the tail may be long, short, or wanting. The proportions of the fore-limbs to
  the hind- vary much in the different groups. The great toe, as well as the thumb, is (except in a
  few species) fully opposable, so that in the majority of members of the Sub-order, the foot is as
  good a prehensile organ as the hand. From this circumstance comes the designation,
  <i>Quadrumana</i>, or "four-handed," so often applied to these animals. In a few species the thumb
  is rudimentary or absent, but the fore-finger, the absence of which characterised some of the
  Lemurs, is always present and well developed, and the corresponding digit in the foot (except in
  the Marmosets) has a flat nail instead of a claw. The mammæ of the <i>Anthropoidea</i> are always
  situated on the breast. If we examine the structures underlying the skin, we find that in the
  skull the orbits are entirely shut in by a bony wall, so that the finger cannot be passed into the
  temporal depression behind, as could be done in the Lemurine skull, and that the lachrymal foramen
  opens within the cavity for the eye. In the present Sub-order there is no toothless space in the
  mid-line of the upper jaw, the incisor teeth being set close together; but there is always a
  vacuity, except in Man, between the incisors and the canine tooth. The lower canine teeth do not
  resemble in form the incisors, nor do they protrude horizontally, as in the Lemurs. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page125">{125}</span>The two halves of the lower jaw are always co-ossified
  together, when the animal is full grown. The <i>humerus</i>, or arm-bone, never has an
  entepicondylar foramen on the inner side of its lower portion, and the bones of the fore-arm (the
  <i>ulna</i> and <i>radius</i>) are never ossified together, nor are those of the lower leg (the
  <i>tibia</i> and <i>fibula</i>); so that there is perfect freedom for every movement necessary for
  grasping and walking, or for rotating the hand or foot on the wrist and ankle.</p>

  <p>With regard to the brain, the anthropoid cerebrum, or fore-brain, is greatly convoluted, and
  differs from that of the Lemurs by its proportionately larger size, the cerebellum, or hind-brain,
  being as a rule entirely covered by it.</p>

  <p>The uterus and structures for the nutrition of the young prior to birth differ greatly in this
  Sub-order from the conditions existing in the <i>Lemuroidea</i>. The uterus is a simple and not a
  two-horned sac, and its inner layer, in which the f&#x0153;tal and maternal structures intermingle
  during the growth of the embryo, is shed after the birth of the young, which is not the case in
  the Lemurs.</p>

  <p>"The resemblance of Monkeys to Man," says Mr. Darwin, "is greatly caused by the relative
  position of the features of the face. The eyes are arched over; they are separated by a long nose,
  the end of which in some is very human. The mouth is not carried back, but occupies the same
  general position as in Man, and the forehead, so often wrinkled, is usually prominent and like
  that of a child. The likeness is increased by the fact that anger, sorrow, pleasure, and
  satisfaction, are displayed by the Monkey by nearly similar movements of the muscles and skin,
  chiefly above the eyebrows and round the mouth. Some few expressions are indeed almost the same,
  as in the weeping of certain kinds of Monkeys, and in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page126">{126}</span>laughing noise made by others, during which the corners of the mouth are
  drawn backward and the eyelids wrinkled. In Man the nose is much more prominent than in most
  Monkeys; but we may trace the commencement of an aquiline curvature in the nose of the Hoolock
  Gibbon, and this in the Great-nosed Monkey (<i>Nasalis larvatus</i>) is carried to a ridiculous
  extreme."</p>

  <p>In regard to the distribution of the <i>Anthropoidea</i>, excluding Man (<i>Hominidæ</i>), two
  families (the <i>Hapalidæ</i> and <i>Cebidæ</i>) are known only from the New World; and two others
  (the <i>Cercopithecidæ</i> and <i>Simiidæ</i>) are exclusively confined to the Old World. No
  fossil remains of Eastern Hemisphere forms have as yet been found in the Western, or <i>vice
  versâ</i>, a fact which indicates, doubtless, a separation of great antiquity between the two
  groups. The various species of these families are to be found chiefly in the warmer regions on
  both sides of the equator. In the New World some species range as far north as to 20° N. lat. in
  Mexico; and South, to 30° below the equator. In the Eastern Hemisphere, the Old World species
  predominate in the tropical and sub-tropical regions; but certain forms have spread as far north
  as Thibet and Japan, and others have made the high altitudes of the Himalaya Mountains their home;
  while to the southward they extend in Africa nearly to the Cape of Good Hope. No indigenous
  species have ever been found in New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, or in the Pacific, or West
  Indian Islands.</p>

  <p>The Apes of the Old World differ in many important characters from those of the New. Among the
  former, as already mentioned, the openings of the nostrils are directed downwards, as in Man; the
  nose is narrow, and the nostrils themselves are set close together, being separated from each
  other by a thin septum, or partition, of cartilage. On this account, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page127">{127}</span>they have received the name of Catarrhine Monkeys (<i>Catarrhini</i>).<a
  id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The New World Monkeys, on the other hand, have the nose
  flat and the opening of their nostrils directed outwards, and the one nostril widely separated
  from the other by a broad cartilaginous septum, and they are therefore designated Platyrrhine
  Monkeys (<i>Platyrrhini</i>).<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The dental formula of the Old World forms is I<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, making a total of thirty-two teeth in
  all; but those of the Western Hemisphere differ in having invariably three pre-molars, and
  sometimes two molars, instead of three, so that they possess either thirty-two or thirty-six teeth
  altogether. There is always a gap, or <i>diastema</i>, in the series of the teeth in front of the
  upper and behind the lower canines; the latter teeth being taller than the rest. Many of the
  Catarrhine Apes have large cheek-pouches as well as bare patches, or callosities, often brightly
  coloured, on the part they apply to the ground when sitting. None of the Platyrrhine group have
  cheek-pouches or callosities, but in many of them the tail is marvellously prehensile, which is
  not the case in any of the Old World species. Again, in the Apes of the Eastern Hemisphere, the
  ear-capsules of the skull have an external bony channel (or <i>meatus</i>) for conveying the sound
  vibrations into the ear, which is absent in the American species.</p>

  <p>As a rule the Platyrrhine Monkeys have the fore-limbs shorter than the hind-, and are more
  quadrupedal than those of the Old World. Their thumb is also more like a finger than the same
  digit in their Eastern brethren.</p>

  <p>Of the New World Monkeys, the <i>Hapalidæ</i>, or Marmosets, have thirty-two teeth, and the
  <i>Cebidæ</i>, with several <span class="pagenum" id="page128">{128}</span>sub-families, have
  thirty-six teeth. The former include the Marmosets (<i>Hapale</i>) and the Tamarins
  (<i>Midas</i>). The latter comprise the Capuchins (<i>Cebus</i>), which may be taken as the
  representative genus of American Monkeys, the Woolly Monkeys (<i>Lagothrix</i>), the
  Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i> and the allied <i>Eriodes</i>), the Howlers (<i>Mycetes</i>), the
  Sakis (<i>Pithecia</i> and <i>Brachyurus</i>), the Night-Monkeys or Douroucolis
  (<i>Nyctipithecus</i>), and the Squirrel Monkeys or Saimiris (<i>Chrysothrix</i>), with the allied
  <i>Callithrix</i>.</p>

  <p>"The extensive equatorial forests of the Amazon and Orinoco, and their tributaries, constitute
  <i>par excellence</i> the home of the American Monkeys, but the majority of the genera have a very
  extended range, appearing in one or more species throughout the greater portion of the tract
  covered by the entire family. This is more particularly the case with the Sapajous (<i>Cebus</i>),
  Spider-Monkeys, Howlers, and the species of <i>Callithrix</i>. The range of the species, on the
  other hand, is not unfrequently very sharply defined, as, for example, when a natural barrier,
  offering insurmountable obstacles to further migration, suddenly interposes itself. Examples of
  such limitation, as brought about by the dominant water-courses of the equatorial forests," are
  numerous. Mr. Wallace cites the case of certain species of Saki Monkey (<i>Pithecia</i>), found on
  either side of the Amazon river, whose range, either southward or northward, appears to be limited
  by that river. "The number of species of these American Apes found in, and north of, the Isthmus
  of Panama is ten, of which only one (<i>Ateles vellerosus</i>) extends into Mexico; <i>Mycetes
  villosus</i>, the Guatemalan Howler, or 'Mono,' has thus far been found only in Guatemala and
  Honduras. It is a little surprising that the range of only two of the species&mdash;the
  Black-faced Spider-Monkey (<i>Ateles ater</i>) <span class="pagenum" id="page129">{129}</span>and
  one of the Night-Apes (<i>Nyctipithecus vociferans</i>)&mdash;extends beyond Colombia, in South
  America."</p>

  <p>"None of the South American Monkeys appear to pass west of the Andean chain of mountains south
  of Ecuador, and even north of the Peruvian boundary the number of such transgressional forms is
  very limited. Indeed, even among the wooded slopes, a habitation along the basal line of the
  mountain axis seems to be much preferred. The greatest altitude at which Monkeys were observed by
  Tschudi in Peru was 3,000 feet (<i>Lagothrix humboldti</i>); <i>Ateles ater</i> and <i>Cebus
  robustus</i> were found at 2,500 feet. On the other hand, Salvin and Godman state that in the
  district of Vera Paz, in Guatemala, the 'Mono' or Howler is most abundant at an elevation of 6,000
  feet; and on the Volcano of Atitlan, in the same country, Mr. Salvin found troops of the Mexican
  Spider-Monkey (<i>Ateles vellerosus</i>) in the forest region of 7,000 feet elevation.</p>

  <p class="sp5">"The range of the Marmosets and Oustitis (<i>Hapalidæ</i>) is nearly co-extensive
  with that of the Monkeys proper." (<i>Heilbrin.</i>) The Pigmy and the Silky Marmoset range as far
  north as Mexico.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE MARMOSETS AND TAMARINS. FAMILY HAPALIDÆ.</p>

  <p>Of the New World, or Platyrrhine, Apes, the Marmosets come to be described first, as they have
  many characters which mark them out as the lowest of the <i>Anthropoidea</i>, and rank them nearer
  to the <i>Lemuroidea</i> than any of the others. They are specially characterised by having only
  thirty-two teeth, their dental formula being I<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span class="ifrac"><span
  class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>. In the actual number of their teeth
  they agree with their Eastern relations, but with this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page130">{130}</span>difference, that in the latter the pre-molars are two, and the molars
  three, above and below on each side. Their flattened nose, with its wide partition between the
  nostrils, and their non-prehensile bushy tails, are also distinguishing characters. The face is
  nude, the ears large and sometimes fringed. Their hind-limbs are proportionately larger and longer
  than their fore-limbs, while the nails of their fingers and toes are not flattened as in the Old
  World Apes, but all form sharp curved claws, except on the much shortened great toe. The thumb is
  elongated and lies parallel, but quite unopposable to, nor indeed is it separable at will from,
  the rest of the digits. The fore-foot, consequently, "is a mere paw, and the term 'hand' is not
  applicable to it."... The plantar surface of the hind-foot "is very long, and the digits are very
  short. It follows from these facts that the term 'quadrumanous' is not applicable in any sense to
  the Marmosets." (<i>Huxley.</i>) These animals have no callosities over the ischial (or buttock)
  bones, and no cheek-pouches. In their smooth and rounded skull superciliary ridges are
  conspicuously absent; and the ear-capsules have, as has been already observed, no external bony
  canal for conducting sound vibrations to the inner ear. The hyoid bone resembles that of the
  Lemurs.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This family has been divided into two genera, distinguished from each other only by
  a variation in the relative length of their incisor and canine teeth, which is so slight as to
  render it doubtful whether these differences really warrant the generic separation of the two
  groups. As, however, the distinction has been maintained by nearly all writers upon these animals,
  the arrangement has been followed here, and the various species of the family will be described as
  true Marmosets (<i>Hapale</i>) and <span class="pagenum" id="page131">{131}</span>Tamarins
  (<i>Midas</i>). They are most numerous in the equatorial forests of South America.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The members of this genus, which are often kept in captivity as pets, are very small animals,
  covered with thick and silky fur, and having bushy tails, equal to or even exceeding the length of
  their body. The head is round, the eyes large and watchful, the face short and nude, and often
  abundantly whiskered. The mouth is large; the ears also large and often fringed, and the neck
  sometimes clothed, with long hair. They are distinguished from the Tamarins (<i>Midas</i>) by
  having their upper incisor teeth long, narrow, and protruding outwards and forwards; the incisors
  of the lower jaw are also very long, and its canines small and shorter than the incisors, both
  being protrusive, as among the Lemurs. The cranial region of the smooth skull is conspicuously
  large in comparison with its facial portion, but the cerebrum shows a low type of organisation,
  and indicates a small degree of intelligence in its possessor; it is smooth and almost devoid of
  convolutions; the cerebrum, too, unlike that of the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, completely covers the
  cerebellum. The orbits are large, and almost completely walled in from the temporal depression
  behind. The stomach in form resembles that found in the higher groups, but its orifices for the
  entrance and exit of food are nearer to each other than in any of the other American Monkeys.</p>

  <p>The female produces two or three young at a birth, instead of one, as is the general rule among
  the <i>Anthropoidea</i>. The species vary much in coloration, and some of them resemble the Lemurs
  in being ring-tailed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page132">{132}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The Marmosets are all gentle and playful in disposition, and are, on this account,
  very largely brought to Europe as pets; but they are very delicate, and rarely survive long in
  confinement after the advent of the Northern winter. They are arboreal, living in troops, and
  feeding on insects and fruit, and not disdaining flesh, especially of fishes, when they can obtain
  it. They emit a characteristic chirping noise.</p>

  chiefly on fruits and insects. It is very susceptible to cold, and lives but a short time when
  removed from the tropics, unless extreme care be taken. Mr. Bates, the author of "The Naturalist
  on the River Amazons," states that when in Para, he counted in a short time thirteen different
  species of Monkey in semi-domestication in the city, either at the doors or windows of houses, or
  in the native canoes. Two of them he did not meet with afterwards in any other part of the
  country. One of these was the well-known <i>Hapale jacchus</i>, a little creature resembling a
  Kitten, banded with black and grey all over the body and tail, and having a fringe of long white
  hairs surrounding the ears. It was seated on the shoulder of a young mulatto girl as she was

  rare little Marmoset&mdash;the prettiest species of its family&mdash;"at first sight for a Kitten,
  from its small size, varied colours, and the softness of its fur. It was a most timid creature,
  screaming and biting when anyone attempted to handle it. It became familiar, however, with the
  people of the house, a few days after it came into their possession. When hungry or uneasy, it
  uttered a weak querulous cry, a shrill note which was sometimes prolonged so as to resemble the
  stridulation of a grasshopper."</p>

  inches, without the tail. Some varieties have the body entirely covered with long, white, silky
  hairs.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Bolivia and Brazil. Mr. Bates says that the Black-tailed Marmoset is
  one of the rarest of the American Monkeys. He did not hear of its being found anywhere in Amazonia
  except near Cametá, on the River Tocantins.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Little is known of the habits of this species, few naturalists
  having had the good fortune to observe it in its native state. Mr. Bates, however, once saw three
  individuals together, running along a branch, and looking like white Kittens. "I afterwards saw a
  pet animal," he says in his book, "of this species, and heard that there were many so kept, and
  that they were esteemed as choice treasures.... It was a most timid and sensitive thing. The woman
  who owned it carried it constantly in her bosom, and no money would induce her to part with her
  pet.... The nervous little creature would not permit strangers to touch it. If anyone attempted to
  do so, it shrank back, the whole body trembling with fear, and its teeth chattered, whilst it
  uttered its tremulous, frightened tones. The expression of its features was like that of its more
  robust brother, <i>Midas ursulus</i>; the eyes, which were black, were full of curiosity and
  mistrust, and it always kept them fixed on the person who attempted to advance towards it."</p>

  <p>This genus differs from the preceding only in the characters of some of the teeth. The canine
  teeth in the lower jaw are longer than their neighbouring incisors; but, as has been pointed out
  by Prof. St. George Mivart, it is a question whether this generic distinction can be maintained,
  as an intermediate condition exists in some forms.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For the convenience of description the species of this genus have been divided into
  two groups&mdash;(<i>a</i>) those with long hair on the head and neck, and (<i>b</i>) those with

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;This is the first species of the long-whiskered and maned group; fur
  soft and silky; tail equal in length to the body, bushy at the tip; hair round the face and on the
  back of the neck very long, forming a conspicuous ruff. Face, hands, and feet purple; general
  colour of the hair golden yellow, more or less red, and glossy.</p>

  <p>These animals are said to possess an air-sac in the throat, at the back of the <i>trachea</i>
  (or windpipe), as in <i>Ateles</i>. Length, 11 inches; tail, 12 inches.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page139">{139}</span></div>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Silky Tamarin is found in the forests of South-eastern Brazil,
  in the coastal forests of New Granada, and as far north as the Isthmus of Panama.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The "Marakina," as this exceedingly beautiful species is often called,
  lives in small troops, ascending to the slender branches at the tops of the highest trees in the
  forest. The species is very playful and intelligent.</p>

  <p>Closely related to the Silky Tamarin, if indeed it is really distinct from it, is the Maned
  Tamarin (<i>M. leoninus</i>, of Humboldt), which inhabits the same region, and is only seven
  inches in length, exclusive of the tail. "It is named <i>leoninus</i>," remarks Mr. Bates, "on
  account of the long brown mane which depends from the neck, and which gives it very much the
  appearance of a diminutive Lion." In referring to their intelligence, the same writer continues,
  "Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire relates of a species of this genus, that it distinguished between
  different objects depicted on an engraving. M. Audouin showed it the portraits of a cat and a
  wasp; at these it became much terrified, whereas at the sight of a figure of a grasshopper or
  beetle it precipitated itself on the picture as if to seize the objects there represented."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Another species, the Golden-headed Tamarin (<i>M. chrysomelas</i>, of Kuhl), which
  is in general colour black, with the head, fore-arms, hands, and a line beneath the tail,
  golden-yellow, is, according to Dr. Gray, "very like a melanism of <i>Leontopithecus</i> (=
  <i>Midas</i>) <i>rosalia</i>; but the hands and feet, which are sometimes blackish in that
  species, are yellow&mdash;that is to say, not changed."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Upper Amazon Region. (<i>Bates.</i>) The Black and Red Tamarin
  is considered by Mr. Bates to be a form or race of the same stock as <i>M. ursulus</i>, modified
  to suit the altered local conditions of its home, for in the Upper Amazon Region, as Mr. Wallace
  has pointed out, the seasons, as well as the nature of the country, differ very considerably.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Mr. Bates states that in its habits the present species is
  similar to <i>Midas ursulus</i>. "One day," he says, "whilst walking along a forest pathway, I saw
  one of these lively little fellows miss his grasp as he was passing from one tree to another along
  with his troop. He fell head foremost from a height of at least fifty feet; but managed cleverly
  to alight on his legs on the pathway; quickly turning round, he gave me a good stare for a few
  minutes, and then bounded off gaily to climb another tree."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Mr. E. Bartlett says that this was the only <i>Midas</i> met with by
  him in Eastern Peru. It was plentiful everywhere in the Peruvian Amazons; and he obtained
  specimens both on the Huallaga and Ucayali rivers.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This species is extremely delicate, and will not bear the least cold. "I
  have had them alive," writes Mr. Edward Bartlett, "for two or three weeks; but they appear to
  suffer from cold and die. They are kept, however, by the Indian women, who make pets of them and
  put them into the long hair on their heads. With this protection they are able to live for a long
  time. Having become tame, they frequently hop out and feed, or, having captured a spider or two,
  scamper back again, and hide under the luxuriant crop of their owners, who are generally unwilling
  to part with them."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The eastern bank of the Rio Negro, a northern tributary of the

  adds: "This place, a waterfall near Barra, which its citizens consider as the chief natural
  curiosity of their neighbourhood, is classic ground to the naturalist, from having been a
  favourite spot with the celebrated travellers Spix and Martius, during their stay at Barra in
  1820. Von Martius was so much impressed by its magical beauty, that he commemorated the visit by
  making a sketch of the scenery, to serve as background in one of the plates of his great work on

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page149">{149}</span></div>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;"The <i>Midas ursulus</i> is never seen," writes Mr. Bates, "in large
  flocks; three or four is the greatest number observed together. It seems to be less afraid of the
  neighbourhood of Man than any other Monkey. I sometimes saw it in the woods which border the
  suburban streets, and once I espied two individuals in a thicket behind the English Consul's house
  at Nazareth. Its mode of progression along the main boughs of the lofty trees is like that of the
  Squirrels; it does not ascend to the slender branches, or take wonderful flying leaps like those
  Monkeys whose prehensile tails and flexible hands fit them for such headlong travelling. It
  confines itself to the larger boughs and trunks of trees, its long nails being of great assistance
  to the creature, enabling it to cling securely to the bark; and it is often seen passing rapidly
  round the perpendicular cylindrical trunks. It is a quick, restless, timid little creature, and
  has a great share of curiosity, for when a person passes by under the trees along which a flock is
  running, they always stop for a few moments to have a stare at the intruder." In Para, the Negro
  Tamarin "is often seen in a tame state in the houses of the inhabitants.... When first taken, or
  when kept tied up, it is very timid and irritable. It will not allow itself to be approached, but
  keeps retreating backwards when anyone attempts to coax it. It is always in a querulous humour,
  uttering a twittering, complaining noise; its dark, watchful eyes, expressive of distrust, are
  observant of every movement which takes place near it. When treated kindly, however, as it
  generally is in the houses of the natives, it becomes very tame and familiar.... It is generally
  fed on sweet fruits, such as the banana; but it is also fond of insects, especially soft-bodied
  spiders and grasshoppers, which it will snap up with eagerness when within <span class="pagenum"
  id="page150">{150}</span>reach. The expression of countenance in these small Monkeys is
  intelligent and pleasing. This is partly owing to the open facial angle, which is given as one of
  60°, but the quick movements of the head, and the way they have of inclining it on one side, when
  their curiosity is excited, contribute very much to give them a knowing expression.... In mobility
  of expression of countenance, intelligence and general manners, these small Monkeys resemble the
  higher Apes far more than they do any rodent animal with which I am acquainted, notwithstanding
  their apparently low organisation in many points."</p>

  <p class="sp5">This description of the habits of the Negro Tamarin may be taken as representative
  of those of the various species of the genus, of whom only glimpses can be caught in their homes,
  which are the safe altitudes of the giants of the virgin forests of Brazil.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE CAPUCHINS, HOWLERS, AND SPIDER-MONKEYS, &amp;c.
  FAMILY CEBIDÆ.</p>

  <p>This family embraces the typical Platyrrhine Monkeys, and to it belongs the great majority of
  the American species. As already pointed out (p. <a href="#page127">127</a>) their nose is flat,
  and the partition between the nostrils, which open sideways, is very broad, and separates them
  widely. They are essentially quadrupedal, and walk with the soles of both pairs of limbs flat to
  the ground. The Spider-Monkeys occasionally, however, assume an erect posture. "They all possess
  tails, and in some genera (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Ateles</i>) this organ becomes very flexible and
  muscular, and the under surface of its curled extremity is devoid of hair and highly sensitive.
  The tail thus modified is a powerful prehensile organ and serves for a fifth hand."
  (<i>Huxley.</i>) In these <span class="pagenum" id="page151">{151}</span>Monkeys there are no
  cheek-pouches, nor ischial callosities. Except in the Spider-Monkeys the hind-limbs are longer
  than the fore-; "while the thumb, even where it is best developed, is capable of but a partial
  opposition to the other fingers, bending almost in the same plane with the latter, so as to be
  more like a fifth finger." (<i>Mivart.</i>) Nevertheless, all its muscles, except the long flexor,
  are present. The great-toe is large and can be moved from and to the side of the other digits, but
  is not opposable to them.</p>

  <p>The skull is smooth and has no muscular crests; the external bony tube to the ear is not
  ossified. The two extremes in its form are presented by the Howling Monkeys (<i>Alouatta</i>) and
  the Squirrel-Monkeys (<i>Chrysothrix</i>), as pointed out by Professor Huxley in his "Anatomy of
  Vertebrated Animals": "In the former the face is very large and prominent, with a low facial
  angle. The roof of the brain-case is depressed; the plane of the <i>occipital foramen</i> [for the
  passage of the spinal cord] is almost perpendicular" to the axis of the base of the skull. "In
  <i>Chrysothrix</i>, on the contrary, the face is relatively small, with a high facial angle; the
  brain-case is moderately arched;" and the plane of the <i>occipital foramen</i> is horizontal.</p>

  <p>The dentition of the <i>Cebidæ</i> is very characteristic of the family. The dental formula is
  I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span class="ifracd">2</span></span>, C<span
  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">1</span><span class="ifracd">1</span></span>, P<span
  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span>, M<span
  class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">3</span><span class="ifracd">3</span></span> and the teeth
  thirty-six in all&mdash;a larger number than is found in any of the Old World forms, or in the
  species of the last family (the <i>Hapalidæ</i>); for they possess an extra pre-molar tooth above
  and below on each side. Their molar teeth are four-cusped; and in the upper molars of the
  Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i>) and of the Howlers (<i>Alouatta</i>) there is an oblique cusp, such
  as is found in the molars of the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, joining the hind inner to the front outer
  cusp. Among the <i>Cebidæ</i> the brain varies <span class="pagenum" id="page152">{152}</span>very
  much; the posterior lobes of the main brain (or cerebral hemispheres, which are almost always
  convoluted) are also almost always so large as to entirely cover over the cerebellum (or hind
  brain), a relation which does not exist between these two regions of the brain in the
  <i>Lemuroidea</i>. The cerebellum, however, in the Howlers is slightly uncovered. The absolute
  size of the brain never, in any Ape, approaches that of Man. None of the <i>Cebidæ</i> attain the
  size of even the medium-sized Old World Apes.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The <i>Cebidæ</i> are all arboreal, and strictly confined to the forest regions of
  Tropical America, from the southern part of Mexico to about the parallel of 30° S. lat. They are
  divided into four sub-families, namely: The Douroucolis, or Night-Monkeys (<i>Nyctipithecinæ</i>);
  the Saki Monkeys (<i>Pitheciinæ</i>); the Howlers (<i>Mycetinæ</i>); and the Capuchin Monkeys
  (<i>Cebinæ</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE NIGHT-MONKEYS. SUB-FAMILY NYCTIPITHECINÆ.</p>

  <p>The Night-Monkeys are small and elegant animals covered with long hair, and having long bushy
  tails, which are not prehensile, although they can be curled round a branch of a tree. The caudal
  vertebræ in these creatures are consequently not flattened from above downward, as is the case in
  the prehensile-tailed groups, but rounded. Their lower incisor teeth are set vertically and their
  thumb is fairly well developed.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This sub-family contains three genera, the Squirrel-Monkeys (<i>Chrysothrix</i>);
  the Whaiapu-Sais, or Titis (<i>Callithrix</i>); and the typical Night-Monkeys, or Douroucolis
  (<i>Nyctipithecus</i>).</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page153">{153}</span></div>

  <p>The Saimiris, or Squirrel-Monkeys, are very beautiful and active little animals, characterised
  by their soft, close, and erect fur, and especially in having the head produced posteriorly. The
  face is relatively small and has a high facial angle. The eyes are large, directed forwards, and
  set very close together. The ears are large; and the nose has a very broad partition between its
  nostrils. The tail is long, round, and covered with short hair; but tufted at the extremity and
  non-prehensile.</p>

  <p>As regards the skeleton, the skull is elongated, and the arched cranial portion prolonged
  backwards, the length of the base of the skull being shorter than the cerebral cavity. The facial
  portion of the skull is relatively smaller and the cranial larger even than in Man; this character
  being, however, common to all the smaller representatives of particular groups, and "obviously
  necessary to provide the requisite amount of brain-space." (<i>Mivart.</i>) The angle of the lower
  jaw is narrow behind. The bony partition between the nostrils is very thin and membranaceous; and
  that between the large orbits is also thin and imperfect. The lower incisor teeth are vertical,
  and in regular series with the canines, and the latter are well developed. No Primate has the
  teeth placed in one uninterrupted series except Man; but there is always a small interval between
  each upper canine and the adjacent incisor, and between each lower canine and the adjacent
  pre-molar.</p>

  <p>The skeleton of the hand is one-fifth of the length of the spinal column. The wrist-bones are
  nine in number, the central&mdash;<i>os centrale</i>&mdash;being present as in the majority of
  Monkeys. In <i>Chrysothrix</i> and in <i>Nyctipithecus</i> also, the thumb is proportionately
  shorter than in any other genus, except among the Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i>), and the Old
  World <span class="pagenum" id="page154">{154}</span>Guerezas (<i>Colobus</i>). In the length of
  their foot the members of this genus approximate to the proportion existing in Man; and its
  length, compared with that of the hand, is greater in <i>Chrysothrix</i> than in any other group
  of Monkeys.</p>

  <p>The cerebral hemispheres project beyond the hind brain (<i>cerebellum</i>) to a greater
  relative extent than in any other mammal, namely, to one-fifth of their total length.
  (<i>Huxley.</i>) The external surface of the cerebral hemispheres is almost as little convoluted
  as in the Marmosets and Tamarins, in which it is almost quite smooth, yet on the inner faces of
  the hemispheres the more important grooves (<i>sulci</i>) are present. The opening for the passage
  of the spinal cord lies nearly in the middle of the base of the skull, whereas in other genera it
  is situated closer to the hinder region.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Squirrel-Monkeys are entirely arboreal, and found in most of the tropical
  regions from Costa Rica to Brazil and Bolivia, being among the commonest of the Anthropoids of the
  American forests. They are diurnal, and feed chiefly on insects; but they will also often attack
  and devour small birds.</p>

  the Amazon, Rio Negro, and on the Copataza river; also in Guiana, Surinam, and Colombia, near
  Bogotá.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Like its congeners, the Common Squirrel-Monkey is arboreal, going about in
  large flocks. Their food consists of insects and fruits. Mr. Bates observes that the "pretty
  little <i>Chrysothrix sciureus</i> contents itself with devouring what fruit it can on the spot,"
  thus differing from certain species of <i>Cebus</i>, which destroy more than they eat, and when
  about to return to the forest, carry away all they can in their hands or under their arms.</p>

  <p>Mr. Darwin has remarked in his "Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals," that "with
  Monkeys the expression of any painful emotion is not easily distinguished from that of anger."
  "Humboldt," he adds, "also asserts that the eyes of the <i>Callithrix sciureus</i> 'instantly fill
  with tears when it is seized with fear'; but when this pretty little Monkey in the Zoological
  Gardens was teased, so as to cry out loudly, this did not occur. I do not, however, wish to throw
  the least doubt on the accuracy of Humboldt's statement."</p>

  <p class="sp3">This species is a great favourite wherever it has been kept in captivity. It is
  very bright coloured, has a baby-like face, large and bright eyes, and most gentle manners. These
  Monkeys are very sensitive to cold, and when a sudden fall in the temperature takes place, they
  huddle close together, clasping each other with their arms, and embracing their neighbours and
  themselves with their long tails.</p>

  <p>This genus is intermediate between the Squirrel-Monkeys and the typical Night-Monkeys. In the
  Titis, sometimes known by the name also of Whaiapu-Sai Monkeys, the fur is soft, the head small,
  depressed, and not produced backward as in <i>Chrysothrix</i>; the tail is long and bushy; the
  eyes are small, and the orbits intermediate in size between those of the last and the next genus;
  the nasal partition is broad, and the ears large. The canine teeth are small, and the angle of the
  lower jaw expanded, somewhat as in the Howlers (<i>Mycetes</i>), though to a less extent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page159">{159}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The Titi Monkeys are diurnal animals, arboreal and gregarious, very lively in
  disposition, noisy and agile, living on fruit, insects, birds' eggs, and even small birds. They
  range all over South America, from Panama to the southern limits of the forest regions.</p>

  been recorded from Cashiboya on the Ucayali, and Santa Cruz on the Huallaga. Mr. O. Thomas
  mentions his having examined twelve specimens from the Copataza river, and one from Andoas in
  Ecuador. Of these he says: "The Andoas specimen, which is a male, differs from the rest in having
  the fur on the back of a dirty orange-grey colour, without annulations, instead of being of a
  bright annulated black and white. One of the others, a female, shows a tendency to this condition
  of the hair, which is, therefore, probably a seasonal change, as the Andoan specimen was shot in

  arrangement resembling that of <i>Mycetes</i>. It was difficult to determine this point in a young
  female; but the swollen condition of the thyroid, together with the existence of a patch of
  ossification on each side, seem to show the possible existence of a howling apparatus in the

  <p>The members of this genus, usually called "Douroucolis," are small animals, somewhat Lemurine
  in appearance, possessing a short, thick body, a rounded head produced behind, and a short, round
  face, encircled by a ruff of whitish fur. The muzzle is not prominent; the mouth and chin are
  small; the <span class="pagenum" id="page167">{167}</span>ears are very short, scarcely appearing
  above the hair of the head; the eyes are enormous and yellowish in colour, imparting to them the
  staring expression of nocturnal animals of prey. Their tail is bushy, moderately long and
  non-prehensile; and the nostrils are separated by a narrower partition than in the other genera of
  the sub-family. Their physiognomy reminds one of an Owl or Tiger-cat (<i>Bates</i>). They are
  covered with close, soft, woolly fur.</p>

  <p>In the skull the orbits are enormously large and closely approximated, but yet separated by a
  complete bony wall; the nostrils, on the other hand, though separated in the living animal by a
  wide, fleshy partition, have only a thin plate of bone between them. The upper incisors are broad;
  the canines long; and the lower incisors project forwards, somewhat as in the Lemurs. The arm-bone
  has a perforation (the ent-epicondylar foramen) on its inner side above the articulation of the
  elbow joint, to give passage and protection to an important artery and nerve. The thumb is very
  short; the claws are small and weak. The dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together number twenty-two,
  the greatest number possessed by any American monkey. As in <i>Chrysothrix</i>, the external
  surface of the cerebral hemispheres is smooth and almost devoid of convolutions, but their inner
  faces exhibit several of the more important grooves seen in the higher Apes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">All the species are arboreal and nocturnal, hiding away in the daytime and roaming
  during the night, giving vent to loud howls, or Cat-like cries, as they move in quest of the
  insects, small birds, and fruits, which form their food. They range from Nicaragua to the Amazon
  and Eastern Peru, and are called "Devil monkeys" by the Indians. They are very delicate, and soon
  die in captivity.</p>

  reddish fulvous; three vertical black stripes on the head, similar to <i>N. trivirgatus</i>, but
  much less distinct, narrower, and showing a prominent triangular white patch over each eye; ears
  large and prominent, almost nude (perhaps the result of captivity). Hands and feet rufous; tail
  short-haired, cylindrical; the basal half rufous, the remainder reddish-black. Length of the body,
  11 inches; and of the tail, 16 inches. The absence of the long chestnut patch on the back
  distinguishes <i>N. rufipes</i> from <i>N. trivirgatus</i>, and its paler colour and the
  indistinctness of its head-stripes, separate it from <i>N. felinus</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page171">{171}</span></div>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species is rather rare, but it has been obtained at Ega and at
  Tabatinga on the Upper Amazons; on the Ucayali, and near Yurimaguas on the Huallaga River&mdash;in
  the warm and humid virgin forests&mdash;in fact, generally along the Peruvian Amazons.</p>

  <p>In speaking of his collections made at Ega on the Upper Amazons, which he describes as a fine
  field for a Natural History collector, Mr. Bates gives an interesting account of the Night-Apes,
  called "Ei-á" by the Indians, observed by him during his various journeys. "Of these I found two
  species (<i>Nyctipithecus trivirgatus</i> and <i>N. felinus</i>) closely related to each other,
  but nevertheless quite distinct, as both inhabit the same forests, namely, those of the higher and
  drier lands, without mingling with each other or inter-crossing. They sleep all day long in hollow
  trees, and come forth to prey on insects and eat fruits only in the night. One cannot help being
  struck by this curious modification of the American type of Monkeys, for the Owl-faced Night-Apes
  have evidently sprung from the same stock as the rest of the <i>Cebidæ</i>, as they do not differ
  much in all essential points from the Whaiapu-Sais (<i>Callithrix</i>) and the Sai-miris
  (<i>Chrysothrix</i>). They have nails of the ordinary form on all their fingers, and
  semi-opposable thumbs; but the molar teeth (contrary to what is usual in the <i>Cebidæ</i>) are
  studded with sharp points, showing that their nocturnal food is principally insects.</p>

  <p>"I kept a pet animal of <i>N. trivirgatus</i> for many months, a young one having been given to
  me by an Indian compadre as a present from my newly-baptized godson. These Monkeys, although
  sleeping by day, are aroused by the least noise, so that, when a person passes by a tree in which
  a number of them are concealed, he is startled by the sudden apparition of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page172">{172}</span>a group of little striped faces crowding a hole in a trunk. It was in
  this way that my compadre discovered the colony from which the one given to me was taken. I was
  obliged to keep my pet chained up; it, therefore, never became thoroughly familiar. I once saw,
  however, an individual of the other species (<i>N. felinus</i>) which was most amusingly tame. It
  was as lively and nimble as the <i>Cebi</i>, but not so mischievous, and far more confiding in its
  disposition, delighting to be caressed by all persons who came into the house. But its owner, the
  Municipal Judge of Ega, Dr. Carlos Mariana, had treated it for many weeks with the greatest
  kindness, allowing it to keep with him at night in his hammock, and to nestle in his bosom half
  the day as he lay reading. It was a great favourite with everyone, from the cleanliness of its
  habits and the prettiness of its features and ways. My own pet was kept in a box in which was
  placed a broad-mouthed glass jar; into this it would dive, head foremost, when anyone entered the
  room, turning round inside, and thrusting forth its inquisitive face an instant afterwards to
  stare at the intruder. It was very active at night, venting at frequent intervals a hoarse cry
  like the suppressed barking of a dog, and scampering about the room, to the length of its tether,
  after cockroaches and spiders. In climbing between the box and the wall it straddled the space,
  resting its hands on the palms and tips of the outstretched fingers with the knuckles bent at an
  acute angle, and thus mounted to the top with the greatest facility. Although seeming to prefer
  insects, it ate all kinds of fruit, but would not touch raw or cooked meat, and was very seldom
  thirsty. I was told by persons who had kept these Monkeys loose about the house, that they cleared
  the chambers of bats as well as insect vermin. When approached gently, my Ei-á allowed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page173">{173}</span>itself to be caressed; but when handled roughly it always
  took alarm, biting severely, striking with its little hands, and making a hissing noise like a
  Cat.</p>

  <p class="sp5">"I have mentioned the near relationship of the Night-Apes to the Sai-miris
  (<i>Chrysothrix</i>), which are among the commonest of the ordinary Monkeys of the American
  forests. This near relationship is the more necessary to be borne in mind, as some Zoologists have
  drawn a comparison between them and the nocturnal Apes of the Lemur family, inhabiting Ceylon and
  Java, and it might be inferred that our American Ei-ás were related more closely to these Old
  World forms than they are to the rest of the New World Monkeys. The large nocturnal eyes and short
  ears of the Eastern Lemurs are simply resemblances of analogy, and merely show that a few species,
  belonging to utterly dissimilar families, have been made similar by being adapted to similar modes
  of life...."</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE SAKIS. SUB-FAMILY PITHECIINÆ.</p>

  <p>The Sakis are characterised by having their lower incisor teeth inclined forward at their
  summits somewhat as among the Lemurs; and separated from the long canines by an interspace. The
  molar teeth are small; the tail, which in some is long, in others short, is non-prehensile. The
  nostrils are, as usual, far apart, and the thumb is well developed. The ears are large. Great
  differences in the character of the fur exist in the group: some species having long hair over the
  whole body, others on the chin and cheeks; some are well bearded, while others again are quite
  bald.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Sakis are divided into two genera, a short-tailed group (<i>Brachyurus</i>),
  containing the Uakarí Monkeys, and a long-tailed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page174">{174}</span>section, the Sakis (<i>Pithecia</i>). Their various species are
  restricted to the great equatorial forests of South America.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE UAKARÍ MONKEYS. GENUS
  BRACHYURUS.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p><i>Brachyurus</i>, Spix, Sim. et Vespert. Bras., p. 11 (1823); W. A. Forbes, P. Z. S., 1880,
    p. 644.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Ouakaria</i>, Gray, P. Z. S., 1849, p. 9.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The species of this genus are at once recognised by their short tail, being the only American
  Monkeys in which this organ is short. The fur is short and silky; the face short, and often
  brightly coloured. The mammæ are situated on the breast. In the skull the lower jaw is dilated
  behind, and certain bones, the parietal and the malar, are in contact with each other for a more
  or less considerable extent on the side walls of the skull. (Cf. W. A. Forbes, P. Z. S., 1880, p.
  639, figs. 5 and 6.) In Old World Monkeys this contact <i>never</i> (except slightly in
  <i>Hylobates</i>) takes place. This is a useful mark for discriminating between the skulls of New
  and Old World Monkeys. (<i>Forbes.</i>) The shortness of the tail is due, not to a reduction in
  the number of the vertebræ, which may be 15 to 17, but in their size.</p>

  <p>In the brain the cerebrum exhibits the more important grooves characterising the brain of the
  higher Apes (<i>Simiidæ</i>) well developed; the cerebellum (or hind brain) is also well
  developed. Thus in its general characters the brain of the Uakarís approaches most nearly to that
  of the genera <i>Cebus</i> and <i>Pithecia</i> (next to be described). By reason of its greater
  complication and development, it departs widely from that of the Titis (<i>Callithrix</i>) and the
  Squirrel-Monkeys (<i>Chrysothrix</i>).</p>

  <p>A relationship to the Howlers (<i>Mycetes</i>), suggested by the external appearance of the
  Uakarís and the form of their lower <span class="pagenum" id="page175">{175}</span>jaw, is not
  borne out by their internal anatomy. The caudate lobe of the liver is very large. This character
  distinguishes the whole of the <i>Cebidæ</i> from the Old World families.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Uakarís are arboreal Monkeys, very gentle and timid. The distribution of the
  various species is singularly restricted, each being confined to a small and particular
  district.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Confined, so far as at present known, to the forests traversed by
  the Rio Casiquiare, Rio Negro, and Rio Branco. This is the most northern form of the three species
  of the genus, and apparently the most widespread also (see map, p. 180). This is doubtless the
  "black-faced, grey-haired" species, neither white nor red, which Mr. Bates was <span

  superciliary hairs, and scant representatives of moustache and beard), all bright vermilion red,
  deepening with emotion. Eyes brown; ears square in shape, without a lobule; hair on top of head
  short, silky, and grey; that on the side of the lower jaw and throat long and rich chestnut-red,
  running forward as far as the symphysis, and forming whiskers. Hair of upper surface of body
  entirely rich chestnut-red, more or less black-tipped and long, especially on the shoulders and
  limbs; hair of head, nape, and neck paler than on the rest of the body; tail, haired below at tip,
  rich chestnut-red; under surface of body rich chestnut-red, and less hairy. The fur in general
  colour and texture resembles that of the Orang, the red hair, continued on to the limbs and tail,
  being particularly long on the arms and shoulders (forming a sort of cape), and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page177">{177}</span>along the hind border of the thigh and leg. (<i>W. A.
  Forbes</i>). Between the thigh and the lower part of the leg there is a wide expansion of the skin
  behind the knee.</p>

  <p>The thumb is in the same plane with the other digits and not opposable; digits with compressed
  and rather elongated nails; the nail of the thumb and the great-toe shorter and more "nail"-like;
  upper surface of the hands and feet haired, on to the fingers. The cæcum (6 inches) and intestines
  (22 inches) are absolutely and relatively longer than in any other New World Monkey.</p>

  <p>Length of the body, 27-28 inches; of the tail, 6½</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Forests on the north bank of the Amazons, opposite Olivença, not
  passing eastwards of Iça on the Iça river. The exact westward extension of this species still
  remains unknown. The young specimen seen at Fonteboa by Bates, and by him referred to this
  species, was more probably <i>B. calvus</i>, as we know from the account given by Geoffroy St.
  Hilaire and Castelnau, that the young of <i>B. rubicundus</i> resembles in coloration the adult,
  and is <i>not</i> paler.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Gregarious and diurnal; living in the high trees, and feeding
  on fruits, probably exclusively, the length of its intestines seeming to indicate that it is more
  of a vegetarian than its allies.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Opposite Fonteboa; banks of the Japurá river west of its mouth. This
  species appears to be confined to the triangle formed by the union of the Japurá river and the
  Amazon. It does not pass east of Ega, nor does it cross to the south of the Amazon, but keeps to
  the forests of the low lands to the north of that boundary and south of the Japurá.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;"This scarlet-faced monkey," says Mr. Bates, "lives in forests, which are
  inundated during the greater part of the year, and is never known to descend to the ground; the
  shortness of its tail is, therefore, no sign of terrestrial habits, as it is in the Macaques and
  Baboons of the Old World.... It seems to be found in no other part of America than the banks of
  the Japurá near its mouth; and even there it is confined to the western side of the river. It
  lives in small troops amongst the crowns of the lofty trees, living on fruits of various kinds.
  Hunters say it is very nimble in its motions, but it is not much given to leaping, preferring to
  run up and down the larger boughs in travelling from tree to tree. The mother, as in other species
  of the Monkey order, carries her young on her back. Individuals are obtained alive by shooting
  them with the blow-pipe and arrows tipped with diluted Urari poison. They run a considerable
  distance after being pierced, and it requires an experienced hunter to track them. He is
  considered the most expert who can keep pace with a wounded one and catch it in his arms when it
  falls exhausted. A pinch of salt, the antidote to the poison, is then put in its mouth, and the
  creature revives.... Adult Uakarís, caught in the way just described, very rarely become tame.
  They are peevish and sulky, resisting all attempts to coax them, and biting anyone who ventures
  within reach. They have no particular cry, even when in their native woods; in captivity they are
  quite silent. In the course of a few days or weeks, if not carefully attended to, they fall into a
  listless condition, refuse food, and die.... The bright scarlet of its face is, in health, spread
  over the features up to the roots of the hair on the forehead and temples, and down to the neck,
  including the flabby cheeks, which hang down below the jaws. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page180">{180}</span>The animal, in this condition, looks at a short distance as though
  someone had laid a thick coat of red paint on its countenance....  After seeing much of the morose
  disposition of the Uakarí, I was not a little surprised one day, at a friend's house, to find an
  extremely lively and familiar individual of the species. It ran from an inner chamber straight
  towards me after I had sat down on a chair, climbed my legs and nestled in my lap, turning round
  and looking up with the usual Monkey's grin after it had made itself comfortable. It was a young
  animal, which had been taken when its mother was shot with a poisoned arrow; its teeth were
  incomplete, and the face was pale and mottled, the glowing scarlet hue not supervening in these
  animals before mature age; it had also a few long black hairs on the eyebrows and lips. The <span
  class="pagenum" id="page181">{181}</span>frisky little fellow had been reared in the house among
  the children, and allowed to run about freely...." This species is rare, even in the limited
  district which it inhabits. A Government official sent six of his most skilful Indians, who were
  absent hunting for three weeks before they obtained twelve specimens.</p>

  <p>In reference to the singularly restricted range of these Uakarís, Mr. Wallace's observations in
  his paper "On the Monkeys of the Amazon," before the Zoological Society of London, are of great
  interest.</p>

  <p>"During my residence," he says, "in the Amazon district, I took every opportunity of
  determining the limits of species, and I soon found that the Amazon, the Rio Negro, and the
  Madeira formed the limits beyond which certain species never passed. The native hunters are
  perfectly acquainted with this fact, and always cross over the river when they want to procure
  particular animals, which are found even on the river's bank on one side, but never by any chance
  on the other. On approaching the sources of the rivers, they cease to be a boundary, and most of
  the species are found on both sides of them. Thus several Guiana species come up to the Rio Negro
  and Amazon, but do not pass them; Brazilian species, on the contrary, reach but do not pass the
  Amazon to the north. Several Ecuador species from the east of the Andes reach down into the tongue
  of land between the Rio Negro and Upper Amazon, but pass neither of those rivers, and others from
  Peru are bounded on the north by the Upper Amazon, and on the east by the Madeira. Thus there are
  four districts whose boundaries on one side are determined by the rivers I have mentioned. In
  going up the Rio Negro, the difference on the two sides of the river is very remarkable.</p>

  <p>The Sakis form the second section of the present Sub-family, and are characterised by their
  long, thick, and bushy non-prehensile tail. A thick beard conceals the large chin. Hair on the
  crown long, divided by a central line, and hanging over the head, half concealing the pleasing
  diminutive face, or confined to the head, cheeks, and chin. The ears are large. The upper and
  lower incisor teeth project forward, the upper inner pair being moderately large, the outer very
  small; canines strong and conical; first pre-molar smaller than the others, and one-cusped; molars
  with square crowns, grooved in the middle and slightly four-cusped.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the brain the whole of the cerebellum and the olfactory lobes are covered by the
  cerebrum. In general form the latter resembles that of the species of <i>Cebus</i>. The frontal
  and occipital regions of the skull approximate in form to those in Man; the angle of the mandible
  is expanded, but less so than among the Howlers (<i>Mycetes</i>). The ribs are relatively broader
  in this genus than in any other of the American Monkeys.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Fur harsh, long and loose, with a hood of forwardly-directed hairs on
  the upper part of the head, neck, and shoulders. Face bare, long, and narrow; nose large and full;
  nostrils widely separated and lateral. Face dark purplish-brown, and black on the nose, paler
  round the eyes, and sparingly covered with short coarse whitish hairs; a yellowish-white patch on
  the cheeks, terminating in front in a distinct line from the inner corner of the eye to below the
  angle of the mouth; margin of upper lips white; ears large, round, naked, and of the same colour
  as the face; upper part and back of head, neck, shoulders, back, arms, thighs, and tail, black,
  washed with yellowish-white, becoming yellowish-brown on the hinder part of the body. Throat,
  breast, under side of body, and inside of thighs, pale yellowish-brown, sparingly haired. Tail 18
  inches long, cylindrical, and bushy at the end; the hair long, coarse, curled, black, washed with
  pale yellowish-brown. Legs black; fore-arm black, washed with white; upper surface of hands, feet,
  and digits, white. Hands small, thumbs short, parallel to the other fingers; nails black, somewhat
  compressed, pointed, that of the thumb flatter; great-toe well developed, standing apart from the
  other toes, its nail flat <span class="pagenum" id="page184">{184}</span>and pointed; nails of the
  other toes long, curved, and compressed.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Mr. Bates states that the "Parauacú," as this Monkey is called by
  the natives of its own country, is found on the "terra firma" lands of the north shore of the
  Solimoens, or Upper Amazon, from Tunantins to Peru. It exists also on the south side of the river
  on the banks of the Teffé, but there under a changed form, which differs from its type in colours,
  as much as the red differs from the white Uakarí. This variety is Dr. Gray's <i>Pithecia
  albicans</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Hairy Saki is a very timid and inoffensive animal, and is
  also, as Mr. Bates tells us in his well-known book, "very delicate, rarely living many weeks in
  captivity; but anyone who succeeds in keeping it alive for a month or two, gains by it a most
  affectionate pet. One of the specimens now in the British Museum was, when living, the property of
  a neighbour of mine at Ega. It became so tame in the course of a few weeks that it followed him
  about the streets like a dog. My friend was a tailor, and the little pet used to spend the greater
  part of the day seated on his shoulder whilst he was at work on his board. It showed,
  nevertheless, great dislike to strangers, and was not on good terms with any other member of my
  friend's household than himself.... The eager and passionate <i>Cebi</i> seem to take the lead of
  all the South American Monkeys in intelligence and docility, and the Coaita, one of the
  Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles paniscus</i>), has, perhaps, the most gentle and impressionable
  disposition; but the Parauacú, although a dull, cheerless animal, excels all in this quality of
  capability of attachment to individuals of our own species, nor is it wanting in
  intelligence."</p>

  <p><b>Characters.&mdash;Male.</b>&mdash;Fur soft; tail bushy and as long as the body; crown with
  long black hair arranged on each side, divided by a central line. "The hair of the head sits on it
  like a cap, and looks as if it had been carefully brushed." (<i>Bates.</i>) Long whiskers on each
  side, and the chin with a moderate beard. Fur black and shining; back sometimes washed with grey
  or ashy-brown.</p>

  <p><b>Female.</b>&mdash;Similar to the male, but having a browner back.</p>

  <p><b>Young.</b>&mdash;Beard absent or rudimentary; hair of crown radiating from centre and
  projecting forwards.</p>

  <p>The skull in this species is sometimes ossified into one piece.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Lower Amazonia; Para; British Guiana; the River Orinoco, towards the
  Rio Negro.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Little is known of the habits of the Black Saki, which is also known under
  the names of "Cuxio" and "Mono <span class="pagenum" id="page187">{187}</span>Capuchino." It lives
  in the most retired parts of the forest, where the ground below it is not inundated by the river,
  and feeds on fruits.</p>

  <p>It is said that this animal&mdash;unlike the next species&mdash;drinks freely, always bending
  down on its hands and putting its mouth to the surface of the water, heedless of wetting its beard
  and indifferent to the observation of onlookers. Sir Robert Porter says that he never saw it take
  up water in the hollow of its hand, and convey it to its mouth to drink. Its voice is a weak and
  chirping whistle, which becomes shrill and loud when the animal is angry.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A young male of this species, which died in the Zoological Society's Gardens in
  1882, presented an abnormal condition. The peculiarity consisted, as Mr. W. A. Forbes, the late
  distinguished prosector to the Society, has pointed out in the "Proceedings," in the completely
  "webbed" condition of the third and fourth digits of the manus (hand) on each side, these two
  fingers being completely connected together, down to their tips, by a fold of nude skin, and with
  their nails closely apposed, though not connected along their contiguous margins. The other digits
  of the hands, as well as those of the feet, were quite normal, the webbing not extending beyond
  the middle of the first phalanx. Mr. Forbes remarks: "The case is interesting, partly as affording
  an excellent instance of an abnormal condition affecting homologous parts of opposite sides in an
  exactly similar way, and partly as showing that the lower Primates are subject, occasionally, to a
  condition of things which, as is well known, also occurs not at all rarely in Man."</p>

  to the Zoological Gardens in London.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE HOWLERS. SUB-FAMILY MYCETINÆ.</p>

  <p>This sub-family embraces only one genus, which is very distinct from all the others. The
  Howlers are the largest of the South American Apes, and are characterised by their thick unwieldy
  body, their pyramidal head, and small facial angle, owing to their long, somewhat Dog-faced
  muzzle. The angle of the lower jaw is very large and massive, and their chief characteristic is
  the conspicuous thickening of the throat, owing to the great enlargement of the hyoid
  bones&mdash;which are widely inflated and cavernous&mdash;to form the curious vocal organ which
  the males of these animals possess, and by which their voice can be so augmented as to be heard at
  a distance of several miles.<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The skull is
  truncated behind <span class="pagenum" id="page190">{190}</span>in the male (less so in the
  female) for the reception of the vocal apparatus. Their incisor teeth are small and equal, the
  canines are prominent and have an oblique ridge across the crown from the outer front, to the
  inner hind, cusp, and the upper molars are large. The tail is powerful and prehensile, naked
  towards the tip, where it is tactile and very sensitive. The thumb is movable, the face is naked,
  and the chin bearded. Some have short, and some have long, fur over their bodies, but it is
  generally more plentiful about the head. In appearance they are the most unattractive and
  repulsive of the American Monkeys. Their intelligence is also of a very low order.</p>

  <p>The roof of the brain-case is depressed; the plane of the opening for the passage of the
  spinal-cord from the brain is almost perpendicular to that of the base of the skull; the condyles
  for the articulation of the neck are situated as far back as possible. Sir William Flower, in his
  valuable monograph on the brain of <i>Mycetes</i>, has shown that the frontal lobes are small and
  the cerebral hemispheres only just cover the cerebellum. In regard to its grooves and
  convolutions, the main brain (<i>cerebrum</i>) of <i>Mycetes</i> can be distinguished from that of
  all other Monkeys. The whole organ is small as compared with the size of the animal; it wants the
  roundness and fulness of that of the Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i>) and of the Capuchins
  (<i>Cebus</i>). Its surface markings are comparatively few and simple, and depart remarkably from
  the ordinary type seen in the order. In the Old World Apes there is a striking similarity in the
  character of the surface markings of their cerebral hemispheres. There is a slight ascensive
  development from <i>Cercopithecus</i> towards <i>Hylobates</i>; and further complications
  overlying the same primitive type&mdash;such as large proportionate <span class="pagenum"
  id="page191">{191}</span>size, and complexity of convolutions&mdash;are observed in the Chimpanzee
  and Gorilla, leading up to the brain of Man. Among the New World genera there is a much greater
  divergence. Among the Capuchins (<i>Cebus</i>), and among them only, there is a precise repetition
  of the Old World type; but in the genus <i>Mycetes</i> we have modifications in which there is no
  parallel among the Catarrhine (or Old World) series. There is an absence in its brain of signs of
  serial elevation; and it exhibits a great dissimilarity to all, even the lowest of the Old World
  forms, and to those American Monkeys, which in brain-character closely resemble Old World Apes. It
  shows an affinity in some of its more striking characters to such low forms of New World Apes as
  <i>Nyctipithecus</i>. The low type of brain is in keeping, as Sir William Flower further observes,
  with their surly and untameable disposition, and with the observation that their intelligence is
  of a very different order from that of their neighbours, the Spider-Monkeys and Capuchins of
  higher cerebral organisation.</p>

  <p>"When Howlers are seen in the forest," remarks Mr. Bates, "there are generally three or four of
  them mounted on the topmost branches of a tree. It does not appear that their harrowing roar is
  emitted from sudden alarm; at least, it was not so in captive individuals. It is probable,
  however, that the noise serves to intimidate their enemies." The muscular power employed in giving
  vent to their cavernous roar appears to be small. Their food consists chiefly of fruits and
  leaves.</p>

  <p>In colour the Howlers vary very much. The young of both sexes often differ from their parents,
  and the females from the males, and there is also great individual variation.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The geographical distribution of some of the species is very restricted, several of
  them being confined to a special district <span class="pagenum" id="page192">{192}</span>of the
  Amazon, into which no other species intrudes. They are found, however, from Eastern Guatemala to
  Paraguay.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>Stentor</i>, Geoffr., Ann. Mus., xix., p. 107 (1812).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The characters of the genus <i>Mycetes</i>, which is the only one of the sub-family, are the
  same as those given above under the sub-family heading.</p>

  <p>The genus contains six well-recognised species. According to Mr. Wallace the red and black
  species of the Amazon have females of the same colour as the males. Humboldt also remarks,
  speaking of the thousands of Arguatoes (<i>M. seniculus</i>) which he observed in the provinces of
  Cumana, Caracas, and in Guiana, that he never saw any change in the reddish-brown fur of the back
  and shoulders, either in isolated individuals or whole troops. Many of the species, however, do
  have the sexes of quite different colours.</p>

  <p>The Howlers are semi-nocturnal in their habits, uttering their cries late in the evening and
  before sunrise, and also on the approach of rain. (<i>Wallace.</i>)</p>

  <p>When a <i>Mycetes</i> is shot it always hangs to the tree, even if quite dead, and does not
  fall till the muscles of the feet and tail relax.</p>

  <p class="sp4">The species of this genus range through Central America, Colombia, and the
  Amazonian region, to Southern Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay.</p>

  Monkeys, which, to the number of thirty or forty, crossed the road by passing in a long file from
  one tree to another upon the horizontal and intersecting branches." On another occasion the same
  celebrated naturalist records that "on approaching a group of trees, we perceived numerous bands
  of Arguatoes going as in a procession from one tree to another with extreme slowness. A male was
  followed by a great number of females, several of which carried their young on their shoulders.
  The uniformity with which the Arguatoes execute their movements is extremely striking. Whenever
  the branches of neighbouring trees do not touch, the male that leads the band suspends himself by
  the callous and prehensile part of his tail; and letting fall the rest of his body, swings himself
  till in one of his oscillations he reaches the neighbouring branch. The whole file performs the
  same action on the same spot. It is almost superfluous to add how dubious is the assertion that
  the Arguatoes and other Monkeys with prehensile tails form a sort of chain, in order to reach the
  opposite side of a river. We had opportunities, during five years, of observing thousands of these
  animals, and for this very reason we place no confidence in these stories."</p>

  <p>"The Arguatoes are sometimes accused of abandoning their young, that they may be more free for
  flight when pursued by Indian hunters. It is said that mothers have been <span class="pagenum"
  id="page195">{195}</span>seen taking off their young from their shoulders and throwing them down
  to the foot of the tree. I am inclined to believe that a movement merely accidental has been
  mistaken for one that was premeditated. The Arguatoes, on account of their mournful aspect and
  their uniform howlings, are at once detested and calumniated by the Indians."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wallace, in a paper "On the Monkeys of the Amazon," in the "Proceedings of the Zoological
  Society," says: "Humboldt observes that the tremendous noise which these Howlers make can only be
  accounted for by the great number of individuals that unite in its production. My own
  observations, and the unanimous testimony of the Indians, prove this not to be the case, one
  individual alone making the howling, which is certainly of a remarkable depth and volume and
  curiously modulated; but on closely remarking the suddenness with which it ceases and again
  commences, it is evident that it is produced by one animal, which is generally a full-grown
  male."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The flesh of this species is very good to eat, and furnishes the principal food of
  the inhabitants of the regions in which it abounds.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.&mdash;Male.</b>&mdash;Hair rather long and entirely of a deep black; hair on the
  back of the head directed forward, meeting at right angles that of the forehead, which is directed
  backward, forming a well-marked semi-circular ridge. Length, 20 inches; tail, 17 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Female and Young.</b>&mdash;Pale straw-colour washed with black; the tips of the frontal
  ridge of hair black; at birth the young are entirely straw-colour.</p>

  <p>Dr. Slack observes that, in the young, about the period of the second dentition, the hairs upon
  the mid-line of the back become black at their bases; soon after, the change takes place upon
  other parts of the body, the black gradually taking the place of the straw-colour, until the
  entire body in the adult male is of an intense black colour&mdash;the adult female having the
  coloration of the half-grown male.</p>

  <p>Mr. Oldfield Thomas, who examined a specimen collected by Mr. Buckley, in Ecuador, points out
  that it agreed exactly with Humboldt's original description of the female of his <i>Simia
  caraya</i>, which he describes as having a black head and back, while the sides and belly are
  yellow. In all recent descriptions, however, the male is described as being nearly uniformly
  black, and the female uniformly yellow; so that Mr. Buckley's specimen appears to be just such an
  intermediate specimen as Humboldt described.</p>

  <p>According to Prof. Schlegel, adult males sometimes have the black on the hands and feet mixed
  with yellow.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page197">{197}</span></div>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This is the species of Howler which ranges furthest to the south. It
  occurs most abundantly in Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia, but Mr. Bates records his having
  obtained a specimen at Villa Nova, on the Upper Amazons, which had come from above Borba, on the
  Rio Madeira. He did not, however, meet with it on any other part of the Amazon region. Mr. Graham
  Kerr saw it in troops on the banks of the Pilcomayo river.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Like nearly all the Howlers, the present species is of a sulky
  disposition, in captivity slinking away out of sight when approached. The members of this genus
  are the only Monkeys which the Indians have not succeeded in taming. They rarely survive their
  captivity many weeks.</p>

  <p>This species is remarkable for great variation in colour. The young at first sight, as Dr.
  Slack has pointed out, appear to be of an intense black colour, but upon a closer examination, the
  hairs, more especially those of the back and sides of the head, are found to be tipped with
  reddish-brown. As the animal becomes older the black gradually vanishes, a yellowish-brown colour

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Differs from <i>M. niger</i> by its abundant, long, and soft hairs,
  which below, towards their bases, show a rufescent tinge, and by the frontal hairs being
  <i>sometimes</i> directed downwards at the base, instead of upwards; hair on cheeks under the
  ears, brownish.</p>

  <p><b>Male.</b>&mdash;Entirely black.</p>

  <p><b>Female and Young.</b>&mdash;Also quite black, like the adult male, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page200">{200}</span>instead of being pale yellow, like the corresponding age and sex of <i>A.
  nigra</i>, and having also the hair shorter and not so glossy.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This Howler is known only from the virgin forests of the eastern and
  north-eastern portions of Guatemala. Mr. Osbert Salvin has given the following account of this
  species. "The <i>Mycetes</i> of Guatemala is commonly known as the 'Mono.' It is abundant
  throughout the virgin forests of the eastern portion of the Republic, but is unknown on the
  forest-clad slopes which stretch towards the Pacific Ocean. In the former region it is found at
  various altitudes over a wide expanse of country. I have heard its cry on the shores of the lake
  of Yzabal; and all through the denser forests of the valley of the River Polochic it is very
  common, from the steep mountain road which lies between the upland village of Purulá and S.
  Miguel-Tucuru, and especially in the wilderness of uninhabited forest, which stretches from
  Teleman to the lake of Yzabal. In the unbroken forest-country which occupies the whole of the
  northern portion of Vera Paz, from Coban and Cahabon to the confines of Peten, it is also
  abundant; for seldom an hour passes but the discordant cry of the Mono strikes upon the ear of the
  traveller, as he threads the lonely path to Peten. The elevation of this district varies from 700
  to 3,000 feet, and the <i>Mycetes</i> is found at all elevations. When travelling through the
  forest in 1862, I was dependent for the animal food, to supply my party of Indians, entirely upon
  my gun, and Monos contributed not a little to the larder. The Indians eat Monkey without demur,
  but the meat looks dark and untempting. For my own part I far preferred the delicate Tinamou or
  Curassow, a sufficient supply of which never failed for my own consumption. Perhaps there is no
  district in Vera Paz where Monos are more abundant than the mountains of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page201">{201}</span>Chilasco, a cold and damp region, elevated at least 6,000 feet above the
  sea, but where the forest-growth is of the densest description and trees of the largest size
  abound. It was here that the specimens were obtained that are now in the British Museum."</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;These animals are found in small companies of five or six. They are
  usually met with on the upper branches of the highest trees, and when disturbed crawl sluggishly
  along the boughs. "The wonderful cry whence <i>Mycetes</i> gets its trivial name of Howling Monkey
  is certainly most striking; and I have sometimes endeavoured to ascertain how far this cry may be
  heard. It has taken me an hour or more to thread the forest undergrowth from the time the cry
  first struck my ear to when, guided by the cry alone, I stood under the tree where the animals
  were. It would certainly not be over estimating the distance to say two miles. When the sound came
  over the lake of Yzabal, unhindered by trees, a league would be more like the distance at which
  the Mono's cry may be heard." (<i>O. Salvin.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp3">To this species, we believe, belongs the following description given by Captain
  Dampier: "The Monkeys that are in these parts are the ugliest I ever saw. They are much bigger
  than a Hare, and have great Tails about two Foot and a half long. The under side of their Tails is
  all bare, with a black hard Skin; but the upper side and all the Body is covered with coarse, long
  black staring Hair. These Creatures keep together, twenty or thirty in a company, and ramble over
  the Woods, leaping from Tree to Tree. If they meet with a single Person they will threaten to
  devour him. When I have been alone I have been afraid to shoot them, especially the first Time I
  met them. They were a great company, dancing <span class="pagenum" id="page202">{202}</span>from
  Tree to Tree over my Head; chattering and making a terrible Noise; and a great many grim Faces,
  and shewing antick Gestures. Some broke down dry Sticks and threw at me; ... at last one bigger
  than the rest came to a small Limb just over my Head; and leaping directly at me made me start
  back, but the Monkey caught hold of the Bough with the tip of his tail; and there continued
  swinging to and fro, and making mouths at me.... The Tails of these Monkeys are as good to them as
  one of their hands; and they will hold as fast by them.... The Females with their young ones are
  much troubled to leap after the Males; for they have commonly two: one she carries under one of
  her Arms, the other sits on her Back, and clasps her two Fore-Paws about her Neck. These Monkeys
  are the most sullen I ever met with, for all the Art we could use would never tame them.... These
  Monkeys are very rarely or (as some say) never on the Ground."</p>

  <p>The late Mr. Alston, in describing the Mammals of Central America, in Messrs. Godman and
  Salvin's monumental work, "Biologia Centrali-Americana," observes that "this Howler presents
  considerable variety in the depth of the black or brown-black ground-colour, and in the extent of
  the fulvous tints of the flanks and loins. Dr. v. Frantzius states that the Howlers which he saw
  in Costa Rica were darker than is indicated by Dr. Gray's description; and in several of the
  Panama examples the light markings are much reduced, but in others they are quite as conspicuous
  as in the Nicaraguan types." Mr. Alston, therefore, agrees with Prof. Schlegel, that the variation
  does not depend on locality.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Shores and islands of the lake of Nicaragua; Costa Rica; Panama;
  Islet of Hicaron, at the southern extremity of Quibo Island, off the Coast of Veragua. South of
  the Isthmus of Panama, the Red Howler (<i>A. senicula</i>) replaces the Mantled Howler.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The habits of the Mantled Howler do not differ widely from
  those of the species already described. It prefers the highest branches of the trees of the dense
  forests; and is harmless to the plantations of the natives. In disposition it is dull and
  melancholy, and is rarely kept in confinement. It is said, however, to reconcile itself to
  captivity more than some of the others referred to in previous pages. According to Dr. v.
  Frantzius, a tame male individual of this species was observed to howl whenever rain-clouds
  gathered, and also regularly at five o'clock every morning.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE CAPUCHINS AND SPIDER-MONKEYS. SUB-FAMILY
  CEBINÆ.</p>

  <p>We now come to describe the remaining Monkeys of the New World. The <i>Cebinæ</i> are
  characterised by having the incisors vertical, not procumbent; they have no inflated hyoid bone as
  in the foregoing Sub-family. The tail in all is long and prehensile, although in some species it
  is a less perfect grasping organ, being clothed with hair to the tip, instead of being there naked
  and highly sensitive. The thumb may be present or absent.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This Sub-family contains four genera: the Capuchins (<i>Cebus</i>); The Woolly
  Monkeys (<i>Lagothrix</i>); the Woolly Spider-Monkeys (<i>Eriodes</i>); and the Spider-Monkeys
  (<i>Ateles</i>). The species belonging to these genera are very numerous, and are found over the
  whole region from Mexico in the north, to Paraguay and Bolivia in the south, or from about 25° N.
  lat., to 30° S. lat.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE CAPUCHINS. GENUS
  CEBUS.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp0 it1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Cebus</i>, Erxleb., Syst. Regne Anim., p. 44 (1777).</p>
  </div>

  <p>This is the typical genus of the American Monkeys. They are distinguished by having a robust
  body, covered with woolly fur, with a rounded head and a face which, instead of having a
  protruding muzzle, is more erect and Man-like. They are the commonest Monkeys seen in captivity in
  our streets. Their tail is long and covered with hair to the tip, and, though prehensile, it is
  not the perfect substitute for an additional hand noticed in several other genera. Their limbs are
  only moderately long, and are less slender than in the Spider-Monkeys. The fore-limbs have a
  well-developed thumb, which, as compared with the length of the hand, is the most <span
  class="pagenum" id="page205">{205}</span>Man-like of all the Apes; in some species the nails of
  the digits are compressed laterally.</p>

  <p>In the skull the cranial portion exceeds the facial. Professor Mivart observes that in this
  group the facial part is relatively smaller than in many of the higher Old-World Apes. The skull
  has no external bony canal (or <i>meatus</i>) to the ear; and its frontal bones possess large
  air-cavities. In the Capuchins the incisor teeth are erect, and are always shorter than the
  canines. The molars are four-cusped, and have, on their crowns, two transverse ridges and the
  oblique ridge, already described in the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, from the front inner cusp to the hind
  outer cusp. These animals have also one milk-molar tooth more than in Man.</p>

  <p>The outer surface of the main brain (<i>cerebrum</i>) is almost as much convoluted as in the
  Old World Apes.</p>

  <p>The Capuchins range from Costa Rica to Paraguay, and are represented by about eighteen species.
  They are very gentle and docile animals.</p>

  <p class="sp3">F. Cuvier observes in his "Histoire Naturelle des Mammiferes," that of all the
  Quadrumana&mdash;indeed, of all the Mammals&mdash;there are none so difficult to characterise as
  the Capuchins of America, whose colours vary almost with every individual. No two authors agree in
  the number of species the genus contains. Brisson recognised three, Linnæus four, Gmelin six,
  Buffon two, and George Cuvier supposed it possible that they all belonged to but one species. Two
  causes help to produce this diversity of opinion; one is, as remarked above, the natural
  disposition which these animals have to vary, and to become lighter or darker in colour according
  to circumstances, and the other is the extremely close relationship that exists between the
  different species of the genus. Observations, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page206">{206}</span>however, are not yet numerous enough, nor exact enough, to enable those
  who have only studied the species alive in Europe, or had skins, to decide with such imperfect
  data as to their sex, age, and habitat. Not until some naturalist has made a prolonged study of
  these animals in their native country, and watched their conduct and relations in the living
  state, can we hope to attain to any certain knowledge of how many species the genus contains; and
  of the differences between the old and young of both sexes at different periods from youth to
  age.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Hair very silky, smooth and stiff, and thicker above than below. Face
  and forehead nude, flesh-coloured; hands and feet nude, of a violet hue, as also the thinly-haired
  skin of the under side of the body. The tip of the tail for a short distance being naked,
  distinguishes this species from all others. Shoulders, arms, and sides of the head behind the ears
  pure white; chest and throat yellowish; rest of the body deep black.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page207">{207}</span></div>

  <p>Older individuals have the head longer than the younger ones, and the shoulders yellowish
  instead of white. Length of the body, 13½ inches; of the tail, 17 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species was discovered by Humboldt in the low lands of
  Colombia. From Colombia its range extends north to Nicaragua. It has been obtained in Veragua, in
  Panama, in Costa Rica, and in the north-east of the country between the Pacuar and Chirripo
  rivers, and also on the mountains of Candalaria.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The White-throated Capuchin feeds partly on fruit, as Mr. Belt has
  narrated in his well-known "Naturalist in Nicaragua." He adds:&mdash;"It is incessantly on the
  look out for insects, examining the crevices in trees and withered leaves, seizing the largest
  beetles and munching them up with the greatest relish. It is also very fond of eggs and young
  birds, and must play havoc amongst the nestlings. Probably owing to its carnivorous habits, its
  flesh is not considered so good by Monkey-eaters as that of the fruit-eating Spider-Monkey; but I
  never myself tried either."</p>

  <p>Mr. Salvin saw a troop of these Monkeys in company with several Spider-Monkeys by the margin of
  a watercourse in Nicaragua, and remarked that the actions of the latter were bolder and more
  active than those of the Capuchins, which were slower and more timid.</p>

  <p>According to Cuvier, the cry of this animal in captivity is a continuous soft whistle until its
  wants are satisfied; if it wants nothing this whistle is intermittent, and very soft. When in
  terror, its cry is a veritable bark, broken by silent intervals.</p>

  <p>It is extremely docile and very intelligent; the look in its eyes is remarkably penetrating,
  and it appears to read in the <span class="pagenum" id="page208">{208}</span>eyes of its observer
  what is passing within him, and to comprehend every motion and gesture.</p>

  <p class="sp3">When pleased it utters a reiterated shrill note, and draws back the corners of its
  mouth, producing a smile by contracting the same muscles as in the human face.</p>

  which surrounds the eyes; forehead, temples, throat, chest, under surface of body, sides of jaws,
  and front of arms, pale orange-yellow; outer side of arms, pale orange, washed with white;
  fore-arms, rump, hind-limbs, and tail black; a mixture of black and brown, expanding irregularly

  black; a superciliary ridge forming a band of whiskers extending down the cheeks, and meeting
  under the chin, also black. Hands naked, violet, almost black.</p>

  <p>Varieties occur with the shoulders and loins pale yellow, instead of mixed black and brown, and

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Little is known of the habits of this species; but F. Cuvier, who had one
  under his care in the "Ménagerie Royale," in Paris, remarks that it had the confiding disposition
  characteristic of the Capuchins, although very timid. It exhibited a great desire to be caressed,
  was very affectionate and most intelligent. Its physiognomy, however, he says, was involuntarily
  repellent, being one that, among ourselves, would indicate a person steeped in ignorance and
  sensuality.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Head large in proportion to the body. Hair of crown short, reflexed,

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Generally distributed through the forests of the level country of
  the Upper Amazon.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Caiarara, as the Tupi Indians name this species, lives in
  troops in the forests and feeds on fruits. Mr. Bates, who kept one in captivity for a considerable
  period during his stay in the Upper Amazon region, describes it as "a most restless creature, but
  not playful like most of the American Monkeys; the restlessness of its disposition seeming to
  arise from great nervous irritability and discontent. The anxious, painful, and changeable
  expression of its countenance, and the want of purpose in its movements, betray this. Its actions
  are like those of a wayward child; it does not seem happy even when it has plenty of its favourite
  food, bananas; but will leave its own meal to snatch the morsels out of the hands of its
  companions. It differs in these mental traits from its nearest kindred, for another common
  <i>Cebus</i>, found in the same parts of the forest, the Prego Monkey (<i>C. cirrifer</i>), is a
  much quieter and better tempered animal.... The Caiarara [called Ouavapavi, by Humboldt] is always
  making some noise or other, often screwing up its mouth and uttering a succession of loud notes
  resembling a whistle." It is the most wonderful leaper of the whole tribe. Mr. Bates has also
  recorded:&mdash;"The troops consist of thirty or more individuals which travel in single file.
  When the foremost of the flock reaches the outermost branch of an unusually lofty tree he springs
  forth <span class="pagenum" id="page215">{215}</span>into the air without a moment's hesitation
  and alights on the dome of yielding foliage belonging to the neighbouring tree, maybe fifty feet
  beneath; all the rest following the example. They grasp, on falling, with hands and tail, right
  themselves in a moment, and then away they go along branch and bough to the next tree." Mr. Belt
  also mentions having kept a White-fronted Capuchin in captivity for a long time. Its actions, he
  tells us, were very human-like. "He had quite an extensive vocabulary of sounds, varying from a
  gruff bark to a shrill whistle; and we could tell by them, without seeing him, when it was he was
  hungry, eating, frightened, or menacing; doubtless one of his own species would have understood
  various minor shades of intonation and expression that we, not entering into his feelings and
  wants, passed over as unintelligible."</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Hairs of crown short, reflexed, but not elevated into a crest. Fur
  brown, washed with yellow; crown-spot dark brown, narrow, prolonged down the nose, and expanded
  <span class="pagenum" id="page216">{216}</span>backward on to the nape of the neck; sides of face,
  throat, chest, and front part of shoulders, greyish-yellow.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Widely distributed in the great forests from Paraguay to the United
  States of Colombia.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This Capuchin wanders about among the high forest trees in small companies
  of from ten to a dozen, the larger number being females. It is very timid, and keeps well out of
  sight, so that it is difficult to watch its habits. Rengger, in his "Säugethiere von Paraguay,"
  had more than once an excellent opportunity of observing these interesting Monkeys, and has given
  a capital account of them. He specially mentions the great affection the mother has for her
  offspring. "The mother's love," he says, "shows itself by the great care with which every old one
  handles her young, by laying them on the breast, by watching them, by searching their fur, and by
  the attacks they make on any intruder." In January the female gives birth to a single young one,
  and keeps it at her breast for the first week; later on she carries it partly on her back, partly
  under her arm. When sleeping the Weeping Çai curls itself up, covering its face with its arms and
  tail.</p>

  <p>The leader of a troop shares his feelings with the others by various motions, and by giving
  utterance to certain noises, which are taken up by the others. Their feelings are also exhibited
  by a kind of laughing and crying. Rengger kept some of these Monkeys for several years in
  captivity in their own country, and says that, when happy, they uttered a peculiar tittering
  sound; they express agreeable sensations by drawing back the corners of the mouth without uttering
  any sound; this he supposed to be laughing, but, as Mr. Darwin remarks, it would be more
  appropriately called a smile. When <span class="pagenum" id="page217">{217}</span>crying, their
  eyes fill with tears, but never flow down the cheeks. When in pain or terror, the form of the
  mouth, as observed by Mr. Darwin at the Zoological Gardens in London, is quite different from that
  expressing pleasure or satisfaction; and high shrieks are uttered.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Specimens of this species have been kept in captivity in Europe for six and seven
  years.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Paraguay.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This rare Capuchin lives, as Azara relates, in the forests of Paraguay,
  and is met with both in single couples and in small troops. They are very lively little animals,
  ever in motion, swinging themselves from tree to tree by means of their tails, the mothers of the
  company generally carrying their single young one on their back. When once tamed they become very
  affectionate; when angry they can give vent to excruciating screams. Their ordinary voice
  resembles that of someone laughing with all their might, and crying Hu! hu! hu!</p>

  <p class="sp3">Only once has a specimen of this Capuchin been an inmate of the Zoological Gardens
  in London.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>Lagothrix</i>, Geoffr., Ann. Mus., xix., p. 106 (1812).</p>
  </div>

  <p>The animals grouped under the genus <i>Lagothrix</i> are readily distinguished by having a
  heavy body, and a rounded head, with the muzzle much flattened, and the nostrils nearly circular,
  but not approximated. More conspicuous than any other external character is the woolliness of
  their under-fur.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Lagothrix</i> was given by Humboldt to the first specimen he found, because of the
  similarity of its fur to that <span class="pagenum" id="page221">{221}</span>of the hare, and
  hence this name, from <span title="lagôs" class="fsn">&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&#x1F7D;&sigmaf;</span>,
  a hare, and <span title="thrix, trichos" class="fsn">&theta;&rho;&#x1F77;&xi;,
  &tau;&rho;&#x1FD0;&chi;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>, hair, was adopted for the new genus, which was
  afterwards established by Geoffroy St. Hilaire.</p>

  <p>The hair of the crown is short and directed backwards; the tail is long and perfectly
  prehensile, being naked and sensitive for a considerable distance back from the tip. The limbs are
  moderately long, and the thumb and great-toe are well developed, the nails of the digits being
  compressed and pointed.</p>

  <p>In regard to the skeleton, the skull of <i>Lagothrix</i>, as Dr. Slack points out, can be
  readily distinguished from that of the Capuchins by a broad, well-marked, articulation taking
  place between the pre-maxillary and the nasal bones at right angles to the suture between the
  latter, while in the Capuchins no true articulation takes place between these bones. The lower jaw
  is larger than in <i>Cebus</i>, approaching the size and form of <i>Mycetes</i>. The incisor teeth
  are small and unequal, the upper inner incisor being the largest; the canines are very large and
  grooved in front.</p>

  <p>The Woolly Monkeys are slow in motion, gregarious, diurnal, and arboreal. The "Barrigudos," as
  they are called by the Portuguese colonists, live exclusively on fruits, and are larger and less
  active than the Capuchins. They are confined to the forests of the Ecuador district of the Upper
  Amazon Valley, and along the slopes of the Andes, north to Venezuela and south to Bolivia.</p>

  <p class="sp3">They are of a mild disposition, and, as Mr. Wallace remarks, they are the species
  "most frequently seen in confinement, and are great favourites, from their grave countenances,
  which resemble the human face more than those of any other Monkeys, their quiet manners, and the
  great affection and docility they exhibit."</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page223">{223}</span></div>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This Monkey was discovered by Humboldt on the Guaviaré, a branch of
  the Orinoco river. It occurs in the Upper Magdalena Valley, Colombia, where it is known as the
  "Churuco" river. Its true habitat is the district south-west of the Rio Negro towards the Andes.
  It is unknown in the Lower Amazon Region.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The "Caparro," as the Orinoco Indians named this species to
  Humboldt, or "Macaco barrigudo," as the Portuguese settlers call it, is entirely an arboreal
  animal, living exclusively on fruits, on which it is a most voracious feeder. The name of
  "big-bellied," which <i>barrigudo</i> means, is probably obtained from the effects of this habit.
  Its manners in captivity are grave, and its temper, according to Mr. Bates, is mild and confiding,
  like that of the Coaitas, or Spider-Monkeys. Owing to these traits, the Barrigudo is much sought
  after as a pet; but it is not hardy like the Coaitas, and seldom survives a passage down the river
  to Pará. Nevertheless, the Zoological Society has had a considerable number of these Monkeys in
  confinement during the past twenty years. Mr. Bates also states that it is much persecuted by the
  natives on account of the excellence of its flesh as food. "From information given me," he says,
  "by a collector of birds and mammals whom I employed, and who resided a long time among the Tacuna
  Indians, near Tabatinga, I calculated that one horde of this tribe, 200 in number, destroyed 1,200
  of these Monkeys annually for food. The species is very numerous in the forests of the higher
  lands, but, owing to long persecution, it is now seldom seen in the neighbourhood of the larger
  villages."</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Large in size; face naked, black; general colour dark reddish-grey,

  under surface long and rather rigid.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Brown Lagothrix, also called "Capparo" by Humboldt, is common in
  the forests of the low country over the whole of the Valley of the Peruvian Amazons. It has been
  recorded from the Valley of the Copataza river, and also from Macas, both in Cis-Andean
  Ecuador.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;These Monkeys go about in pairs, in troops of about twelve to
  fourteen, and frequent the great forest trees. They are often found in company with species of
  other genera, such as the Howlers. They are exclusively fruit-eaters, and are in great request as
  food; large numbers, consequently, are destroyed annually for this purpose.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The members of this genus resemble in general form the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page225">{225}</span>Spider-Monkeys, to be presently described, and they present also many
  resemblances to the foregoing species of the Woolly Monkeys. Their limbs are long and slender, and
  their body heavy, and covered with a woolly under-fur. Their head is rounder than in the
  Capuchins. The face is flat, and the facial angle large. The nose has the partition between the
  nostrils narrower than in the other species of the family, and the nostrils are themselves more
  approximated, circular in form, and directed more downward than outward, thus showing some
  approach to the position of the nostrils in the Old World Apes. Their fore-limbs are long and
  slender, and the thumb is often entirely absent (as in the Guerezas of Africa), or there may be a
  very rudimentary digit, which sometimes ends in a small nail. The nails of the digits are, as in
  <i>Lagothrix</i>, very compressed and sharp. The tail is longer than the body, naked on the under
  side, and sensitive at its termination, and therefore prehensile.</p>

  <p>The skull is globular, and the pre-maxillary bones articulate with the nasal bones by a broad
  surface. The incisor teeth are equal in size; the canines are small, and of the same length as the
  incisors, and the molars, which are vertically higher than the canines, are thick and
  quadrangular. The lower jaw is dilated behind, somewhat less than in <i>Lagothrix</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Woolly Spider-Monkeys are very rare, and little is known of their habits. They
  are confined to the south-eastern coast forests of Brazil, that region to the south of Cape San
  Roque, whence, as far as Rio Grande do Sul, ever-verdant forests, as Mr. Wallace has described,
  clothe all the valleys and hills of the lowland region, stretching as far west as the higher
  mountain ranges parallel to the coast, and even up the valleys of the larger rivers a long way
  into the interior of the country.</p>

  <p>Dr. Slack observes, in the "Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia" for
  1862, in reference to this species: "I had long suspected that the three species of this genus
  described by Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire, were in reality one and the same; no specific
  characters are manifest in their coloration, or skulls, the supposed differences being <span
  class="pagenum" id="page227">{227}</span>based upon the development of the anterior thumbs, this
  member being absent in <i>B. arachnoides</i>, replaced by a small nailless tubercle in <i>B.
  tuberifer</i>, and surmounted by a nail in <i>B. hemidactylus</i>. In the "Magazin" of Messrs.
  Verreaux, in Paris, I found specimens having upon one hand the tubercle, and upon the other the
  nailed thumb, others with the tubercle on one hand, but absent upon the other. St. Hilaire
  himself, in his "Catalogue of the Primates," expresses a doubt as to whether <i>B. arachnoides</i>
  and <i>B. hemidactylus</i> are really distinct. In September and October, 1860, I was unable to
  find <i>B. hemidactylus</i> in the Paris Museum, all the <i>Brachyteles</i> being labelled
  <i>Eriodes arachnoides</i>."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Confined to the wooded region of the south-east of Brazil.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This is the fourth remaining genus of the <i>Cebinæ</i>, the last Sub-family of the
  <i>Cebidæ</i>. With the description of the Spider-Monkeys, therefore, we shall have passed in
  review all the species of the New World Platyrrhine section of the <i>Anthropoidea</i>. The
  species of this group derive their trivial name from their long and slender limbs; the name
  applied to them, however, in their native forests by the Indians of Brazil is "Coaita." They are
  characterised by their light and slender body, which is narrower across the loins than across the
  chest. The head is rounded, the forehead salient, and the muzzle somewhat projecting. Both pairs
  of limbs are much elongated, the <span class="pagenum" id="page228">{228}</span>hind-limbs being
  shorter, however, than the fore-, and the thumb of the fore-limb is sometimes very rudimentary,
  being only a nailless tubercle&mdash;or, in the majority of the species, entirely absent,
  rendering the hand a much less perfect organ for holding or picking up small objects, such as
  fruits, &amp;c.; but its absence probably does not affect, if it does not even benefit, the hand
  as an organ for climbing and catching hold again after a long leap. The nails and other digits of
  both limbs are compressed, but much less so than in <i>Brachyteles</i> and <i>Lagothrix</i>. The
  tail is very long, generally exceeding the length of the body and head, and is nude on the under
  side, and very sensitive towards its termination. As a prehensile organ it has reached the summit
  of strength and perfection. "It even serves as a fifth hand, as detached objects, otherwise out of
  reach, can be grasped by it, and brought towards the hand or mouth." (<i>Mivart.</i>) The body is
  covered with long, rather coarse, generally black, hair, and has no woolly under-fur, as in
  <i>Lagothrix</i> and <i>Brachyteles</i>.</p>

  <p>With regard to the skeleton of <i>Ateles</i>, the lumbar region of the vertebral column is
  short, and the dorsal segment attains a greater relative length than in any other Ape, being over
  nine-twentieths of the total length of the spine, without the tail. (<i>Mivart.</i>) The dorsal
  and lumbar vertebræ together number eighteen. In the tail there are twenty-three vertebræ,
  flattened on the under side, and exceptionally provided with bony processes, serving as points for
  the attachment of muscles for rendering it as efficient a prehensile organ as possible. The length
  of the whole arm and hand in <i>Ateles</i>, in proportion to that of the spine, is 174 to 100; but
  without the hand it is shorter than the spine, the hand itself being only slightly shorter than
  the latter. The proportion of the hind-limb to the spine is somewhat less, being 169 to 100. The
  thumb is reduced to a single metacarpal bone, to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page229">{229}</span>which, usually, a single minute nodular phalanx [finger-bone] is
  articulated, and is completely hidden beneath the integument. Although thus rudimentary and
  functionless, all its characteristic muscles, except one (the long-flexor) are present.
  (<i>Huxley.</i>) The upper incisors are unequal, the interior being the larger. There is a space
  (diastema) between the incisor and the canine teeth (as in all <i>Anthropoidea</i>, except Man);
  the canines are large and conical; the upper molars large, and their crowns four-cusped, with
  transverse ridges between the outer and inner front cusps and the outer and inner hind cusps, and
  also an oblique ridge crossing from the outer front cusp to the inner hind one. In the larynx of
  <i>Ateles</i> there is a single median air-sac opening from the back of the windpipe, but there is
  no such extension of the resonating apparatus as is seen in the Howlers (<i>Alouatta</i>). In its
  brain <i>Ateles</i> exhibits in some respects a higher type than in even the Old World Apes.</p>

  <p>In regard to this group of Monkeys, the late Mr. H. W. Bates made the following interesting
  observations:&mdash;"In the Coaitas the tail reaches its highest perfection as a prehensile organ;
  and on this account it would perhaps be correct to consider the Coaitas as the extreme development
  of the American type of Apes. As far as we know from living and fossil species, the New World has
  progressed no further than the Coaita towards the production of a higher form of the Quadrumanous
  order. The tendency of Nature here has been, to all appearance, simply to perfect these organs,
  which adapt the species more and more completely to a purely arboreal life; and no nearer approach
  has been made towards the more advanced forms of Anthropoid Apes, which are the products of the
  Old World solely. The tail of the Coaita is endowed with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page230">{230}</span>a wonderful degree of flexibility. It is always in motion, coiling and
  uncoiling like the trunk of an Elephant, and grasping whatever comes within reach.... The flesh of
  the Coaitas is much esteemed by the natives in this part of the country [Obydos, on the
  Amazon].... One day I went on a Coaita hunt. When in the deepest part of a ravine we heard a
  rustling sound in the trees overhead, and Manoel [the guide] pointed out a Coaita to me. There was
  something human-like in its appearance [which is very characteristic of them], as the lean, dark,
  shaggy creature moved deliberately amongst the branches at a great height. I fired, but
  unfortunately only wounded it in the belly. It fell with a crash headlong about twenty or thirty
  feet, and then caught a bough with its tail, which grasped it instantaneously, and then the animal
  remained suspended in mid-air. Before I could re-load it recovered itself, and mounted nimbly to
  the topmost branches out of the reach of a fowling-piece, where we could perceive the poor thing,
  apparently probing the wound with its fingers. Coaitas are more frequently kept in a tame state
  than any other kind of Monkey. The Indians are very fond of them as pets, and the women often
  suckle them when young at their breasts.<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> They
  become attached to their masters, and will sometimes follow them on the ground to considerable
  distances.... The disposition of the Coaita is mild in the extreme; it has none of the painful,
  restless vivacity of its kindred, the <i>Cebi</i>, and no trace of the surly, untameable temper of
  its still nearer relatives, the <i>Mycetes</i>, or Howling-Monkeys. It is, however, an arrant
  thief, and shows considerable cunning in pilfering small articles of clothing, which it conceals
  in its sleeping place."</p>

  whole of the under side of the tail as far as the nude portion (which is black), rich
  orange-yellow; under surface of body paler. Face naked, black, and bordered by a broad white patch
  of whiskers, reaching from the temple nearly to the angle of the mouth. The black part of the
  limbs and legs near to the yellow colour, varied with more or fewer yellow hairs.</p>

  <p><b>Female and Young Male.</b>&mdash;Similar to the adult male, but less in size, and the
  coloration paler than in the adult male. Elbows and feet black; under side of the body
  greyish-yellow. The white stripe on the sides of the face is wanting in the young female.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Chyavetas, Nauta, and Elvira in the Peruvian Amazons; Upper Rio
  Negro, Serra de Cocoi; Upper Cauca river, a southern confluent of the Orinoco; Venezuela. "This
  species is found on both sides of the Peruvian Amazon (or Marañon), on both shores of the
  Huallaga, and in the interior forest near the town of Chamicuros. I was told by some of the oldest
  Indians that these animals are common in the dense forest on the hills near the latter town, their
  range extending between the Huallaga river and Ucayali river to the head-waters of the Huallaga,
  between the towns of Lamas and Sarayaçu.... Then again on the Rio Tigri ... and over the
  head-waters of the Rio Napo, Rio Japurâ and Rio Negro, where Natterer first discovered it."

  </div>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Body light greyish-drab all over; hands, elbows, feet, knees, and the
  upper side of the extremity of the tail, black; face black, with the exception of the lips and a
  ring round the eyes, broad above and narrow below, flesh-coloured. Hair of forehead reflexed,
  meeting that of the crown above the eyes, forming a triangular patch of erect black hairs. Top of
  the head and upper part of the tail buff. Length of body, 17 inches; of tail, 21 inches. Thumb
  entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>This species is remarkably variable. The description given above belongs to the form described
  as <i>A. melanochir</i> by <span class="pagenum" id="page234">{234}</span>Desmarest from the same
  specimen in Paris, which Kuhl described under the name of <i>A. geoffroyi</i>. Every gradation is
  to be met with between this and the form described by Dr. Gray as <i>A. ornatus</i>, in which the
  face is entirely black, the whiskers pale reddish-yellow, the patch of erect black hair on the
  forehead yellowish at its base; the top of the head, sides, lower back, rump, upper part of the
  arms, outer, inner and posterior portion of the thighs and legs, and under side of the base of the
  tail, brownish-red; nape, shoulders and remainder of the tail reddish-brown, washed with black;
  lower part of arms, fore-arms, hands, feet, and anterior aspect of thighs and legs, black.</p>

  <p>In some specimens the grey, or reddish-black colour, merges on the under surface, into
  yellowish-cream, or rufous, and the black wash is more or less distributed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Alston, in speaking of this species, remarks that the best character by which the darker
  (<i>A. ornatus</i>) forms may be distinguished from our next species (<i>A. rufiventris</i>) is
  the want of a distinct line of demarcation between the colours of the upper and lower parts, the
  tint of the flanks, whatever it may be, passing almost insensibly into that of the breast and
  belly in all the varieties.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The variation in colour described above is not due to local causes,
  every variety occurring between the lightest and darkest, in all the regions which this species is
  known to inhabit. The localities from which it has been recorded are on both the Atlantic and
  Pacific coasts of Nicaragua; Costa Rica, where it occurs in large numbers from the coast forests
  up to nearly 7,000 feet on the mountains; Panama, and the U.S. of Colombia.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Geoffroy's Spider-Monkey is gregarious and arboreal, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page235">{235}</span>frequenting the highest trees of the forest, both in the low country and
  at high elevations, and living on fruits and insects, but chiefly on the former. Mr. Belt relates
  that on the banks of the Antigua he saw a valuable tree, the "Nispera" (<i>Achras sapota</i>),
  growing on the dryer ridges. "It bears a round fruit about the size of an apple, hard and heavy
  when green, and at this time it is much frequented by the large yellowish-brown Spider-Monkey
  (<i>Ateles</i>), which roams over the tops of the trees in bands of from ten to twenty. Sometimes
  they lay quite quiet until I was passing underneath, when, shaking a branch of the Nispera tree,
  they would send down a shower of the hard round fruit; but fortunately I was never struck by them.
  As soon as I looked up they would commence yelping and barking and putting on the most threatening
  gestures, breaking off pieces of branches and letting them fall, and shaking off more fruit, but
  never throwing anything, simply letting it fall.<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
  Often when on lower trees, they would hang from the branches, two or three together, holding on to
  each other and to the branch with their fore-feet and long tail, whilst their hind-feet hung down,
  all the time making threatening gestures and cries. Sometimes a female would be seen carrying a
  young one on its back, to which it clung with legs and tail, the mother making its way along the
  branches, and leaping from tree to tree, apparently but little encumbered by its baby. A large
  black and white Eagle is said to prey upon them, but I never saw one, although I was constantly
  falling in with troops of the Monkeys. Don Francisco Velasquez, one of our officers, told me that
  one day he heard a Monkey crying out in the forest for more than two hours, and at last, going to
  see what was <span class="pagenum" id="page236">{236}</span>the matter, he saw a Monkey on a
  branch and an Eagle beside it trying to frighten it to turn its back, when it would have seized
  it. The Monkey, however, kept its face to its foe.... Velasquez fired at the Eagle, and frightened
  it away. I think it likely, from what I have seen of the habits of this Monkey, that they defend
  themselves from the Eagle's attack by keeping two or three together, thus assisting each other,
  and that it is only when the bird finds one separated from its companions that it dares to attack
  it."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. Osbert Salvin met with several of these Monkeys near the town of San Juan del
  Sur, in Nicaragua. He was walking up the course of a half-dry stream when he came upon a troop of
  Monkeys which had come to a pool to drink, and were climbing about the low trees on the bank of
  the watercourse. Most of the troop consisted of <i>Cebus hypoleucus</i>, but with them were
  several <i>Ateles</i> of the present species, of one of which Mr. Salvin wrote a description as it
  sat jabbering at him and throwing down sticks from a branch above his head. Mr. Salvin also told
  Mr. Alston that it was not unusual to see Monkeys kept in confinement in the court-yards of the
  Spanish houses in Guatemala. Amongst them were occasionally to be seen specimens of Geoffroy's
  Spider-Monkey; but he always found that they had been brought from Nicaragua or Costa Rica, the
  species not extending into Guatemala.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Very similar to <i>A. ater</i> in its coarse and entirely black fur,
  but differing in the naked and flesh-coloured <span class="pagenum" id="page238">{238}</span>face.
  Hairs of forehead long and projecting anteriorly; tail one-quarter longer than the body; hands
  generally entirely lacking the thumbs, though sometimes a rudimentary thumb is present, and that
  occasionally on one hand only. Naked portion of tail covered with sensory papillæ, rendering it
  more sensitive, so it is said, than the hand. Length of body, 24 inches; tail, 30 inches. The
  skull in some specimens of the thumbed variety is compressed laterally, and shows a sagittal crest
  along the top.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species is spread over Guiana, the forests of the Ucayali and
  Huallaga rivers in eastern Peru, and the northern part of Brazil, where it is known as the
  "Coaita," taking the place of the more northern <i>Ateles ater</i>. "It occurs," says Mr. Bates,
  "throughout the lowlands of the Lower and Upper Amazons, but does not range to the south beyond
  the limits of the river plains." In the higher part of the Rio Negro it comes down to the north
  bank, but does not cross to the south bank of the river.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This species is the best known of all the Spider-Monkeys. It
  is captured in large numbers, when young, by the natives of Guiana, and as they bear captivity
  well, many of them have been brought to Europe. They live in larger troops than do some of the
  other members of its genus; indeed, these companies are said to number as many as a hundred. They
  are very easily tamed, and become very affectionate. They live chiefly on fruits, principally on a
  species of palm-nut. Dampier, however, says, apparently of this species of <i>Ateles</i>: "The
  Monkeys come down by the Sea-side [at low water] and catch them [the Periwinckles and Muscles];
  digging them out of their Shells with their Claws." Large numbers of this species <span
  class="pagenum" id="page239">{239}</span>are also annually killed for food, their flesh being held
  in high esteem by the natives.</p>

  moderately long and coarse. Face naked, black, except the skin round the eyes, which is
  flesh-coloured; general colour black; under surface of body and inner sides of limbs, ashy-grey.
  It differs from <i>A. paniscus</i> by having the forehead, crown of head, a spot on each side of
  the nose, and the whiskers, white.</p>

  <p>A specimen in the British Museum has four pre-molars in each upper jaw, instead of the normal
  three of the <i>Cebidæ</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species was discovered by Humboldt on the banks of the Santiago
  river. Mr. Bates says "it is never met with in the alluvial plains of the Amazons," nor, he
  believes, on the northern side of the great river-valley, except towards its head-waters near the
  Andes.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;According to Von Humboldt, this Spider-Monkey&mdash;known as
  the "White-Whiskered Coaita"&mdash;is very fierce and libidinous. Mr. Bates encountered this large
  and handsome species on the Cupari river, a tributary of the Tapajos, one <span class="pagenum"
  id="page240">{240}</span>of the large southern affluents of the Amazon. Here he could get scarcely
  anything but fish to eat, and, as this diet did not agree with him, he was obliged to have
  recourse to the Coaita flesh. "I thought," he says, "the meat the best flavoured I have ever
  tasted. It resembled beef, but had a richer and sweeter taste.... We smoke-dried the joints
  instead of salting them; placing them for several hours on a framework of sticks arranged over a
  fire. Nothing but the hardest necessity could have driven me so near to cannibalism as this, but
  we had the greatest difficulty in obtaining here a sufficient supply of animal food." Von Humboldt
  has also referred to the cooking of these Monkeys by the natives of the Upper Orinoko. "The manner
  of roasting these anthropomorphous animals," he writes, "contributes singularly to render their
  appearance disagreeable in the eyes of civilised Man. A little grating or lattice of very hard
  wood is formed, and raised one foot from the ground. The Monkey is skinned and bent into a sitting
  posture; the head generally resting on the arms, which are meagre and long; but sometimes these
  are crossed behind the back. When it is tied on the grating a very clear fire is kindled below....
  On seeing the natives devour an arm or leg of a roasted Monkey, it is difficult not to believe
  that this habit of eating animals which so much resemble Man in their physical organisation, has
  in a certain degree contributed to diminish the horror of anthropophagy among savages. Roasted
  Monkeys, particularly those that have a very round head, display a hideous resemblance to a child;
  the Europeans, therefore, who are obliged to feed on Quadrumanes, prefer separating the head and
  the hands, and serve up only the rest of the animal at their tables. The flesh of Monkeys is so
  lean and dry that Mr. Bonpland has <span class="pagenum" id="page241">{241}</span>preserved in his
  collections at Paris an arm and hand, which had been boiled over the fire at Esmeraldas; and no
  smell arises from them after a great number of years."</p>

  Reinhardt, "in the neighbourhood of the small place Mirador, situated not far from the volcano of
  Orizaba, in the State of Vera Cruz.... He met with it also in the eastern parts of the State of
  Oaxaca.... But at the same time he expressly states that he never met with this <i>Ateles</i>,
  nor, indeed, with any other Monkey, on the Pacific slope of the Great Cordillera in Oaxaca, and
  that, as far as he could learn, Monkeys are to be found on the western coast only south of
  Tehuantepec." This species is the only Spider-Monkey certainly known to range as far north as
  Mexico. According to M. Sallé, the most northern locality for Monkeys with which he was
  acquainted, was in the State of San-Louis Potosi, about 23° N. latitude, on the upper part of the
  basin of the Tampico river. (<i>Alston.</i>)</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Mexican Spider-Monkey is, like the foregoing members of the genus,
  arboreal, consorting together in small troops, and feeding on fruits. Prof. Liebmann observed it
  in small troops in the deep barrancas, up to an elevation of 2,000 <span class="pagenum"
  id="page246">{246}</span>feet above the sea, on the Orizaba volcano, and in the forests of Oaxaca,
  to 4,000 feet. Mr. Salvin, on the volcano of Atitlan, in Guatemala, at a height of between 5,000
  and 6,000 feet, met several troops of this species on the tops of the higher trees of the forest.
  These parties of Monkeys were usually about twenty in number and of all ages. On approaching them
  they did not evince any alarm, but kept uttering a constant querulous sort of bark, and moved from
  time to time so as to get a better view of the intruder. A few days afterwards, during an
  excursion to the same volcano, when the summit, 11,800 feet above the sea, was reached, numerous
  troops of <i>Ateles</i> were seen in the forest, from an elevation of 7,000 feet to as low as
  2,500 feet on the outskirts of the coffee plantations of San Agustin.</p>

  <p>Now that we have passed in review the whole of the Anthropoid species inhabiting the New World,
  a short account of the regions to which they are confined will be of some interest. The most
  northern limit of Monkeys is, as mentioned above, the State of San-Louis Potosi, about the
  latitude of 23° North. Their most southern limit attains to nearly 25° of South latitude. They are
  now confined to the Mexican and Brazilian sub-regions of what has been defined as the Neotropical
  Region, by Dr. A. R. Wallace, in his great work, "The Geographical Distribution of Animals." The
  Mexican sub-region belongs to the Neotropical Region, one of those six great areas into which the
  globe has been divided off by Dr. Sclater on the basis of the geographical distribution of the
  animals that now inhabit it&mdash;the final product of the slowly-changing features of the earth's
  surface, and of the form, structure, and habits of its animal and vegetable life.</p>

  <p>The Mexican sub-region forms the northern part of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page247">{247}</span>Region, and, to condense Mr. Wallace's account of it, it is of
  comparatively small extent; but the whole of its area is mountainous, being, in fact, a
  continuation of the great range of the Rocky Mountains. It varies in elevation above the sea from
  6,000 to 18,000 feet. "With the exception of the elevated plateaus of Mexico and Guatemala, and
  the extremity of the peninsula of Yucatan, the whole of Central America is clothed with forests;
  and as its surface is much broken up into hill and valley, and the volcanic soil of a large
  portion of it is very fertile, it is altogether well adapted to support a varied fauna, as it does
  a most luxuriant vegetation." In this region only species of Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i>), of
  Howlers (<i>Alouatta</i>), of Capuchins (<i>Cebus</i>), of Night-Monkeys (<i>Nyctipithecus</i>),
  and of Squirrel-Monkeys (<i>Chrysothrix</i>) are found. The Spider-Monkeys and the Howlers alone
  extend so far North as Mexico, and the Night-Monkeys reach to Nicaragua, while the
  Squirrel-Monkeys and Capuchins have penetrated no further than to Costa Rica.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Brazilian Sub-region includes all the open plains and pasture lands, surrounded
  by, or intimately associated with, the forests. Its central mass consists of the great forest
  plain of the Amazons, from the north-east coast of Brazil to high up in the Andes on the west, a
  stretch of more than 2,000 miles; and from the mouth of the Orinoko to near La Paz in the Bolivian
  Andes, a distance of 1,900 miles, of continuous forest in both directions. Within this area are
  some open "campos" or patches of pasture lands, along several of the tributaries of the Amazon,
  and Llanos&mdash;open flat plains generally flooded in the wet season&mdash;on the northern bank
  of the Orinoko. Unbroken forest also covers the country from Panama southwards by the Magdalena
  Valley along the western aspect of the <span class="pagenum" id="page248">{248}</span>Andes to
  Guayaquil. There is a very arid tract on the northeast coast of Brazil; but south of Cape San
  Roque the coast forests extend to 30° south latitude, "clothing all the valleys and hill-sides as
  far inland as the higher mountain ranges, and even penetrating up the great valleys far into the
  interior. To the south-west the forest country reappears in Paraguay, and extends in patches and
  partly wooded country till it almost reaches the southern extension of the Amazonian forests. The
  interior of Brazil is thus in the position of a great island plateau, rising out of, and
  surrounded by, a lowland region of ever-verdant forests." Of its Anthropoid life the Woolly
  Monkeys (<i>Lagothrix</i>), the Sakis (<i>Pithecia</i>), and the Uakaris (<i>Brachyurus</i>) are
  confined to its Amazonian forests. The Woolly Spider-Monkeys (<i>Brachyteles</i>) keep to the
  wooded coast-regions of South-east Brazil, while the Titis (<i>Callithrix</i>) do not range out of
  the tropics of South America. The Howlers (<i>Alouatta</i>), the Spider-Monkeys (<i>Ateles</i>),
  and the Capuchins (<i>Cebus</i>) roam nearly over the whole region&mdash;the first and last
  ranging from Costa Rica to Paraguay as well. The Spider-Monkeys indeed extend over to the west
  side of the Equatorial Andes, and in Guatemala across to the Pacific coast. No species of Monkey,
  however, is known to inhabit the western side of the Andes, to the south of the Gulf of
  Guayaquil.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE BABOONS, GUEREZAS AND LANGURS. FAMILY
  CERCOPITHECIDÆ.</p>

  <p>With the following account of the numerous species of the genera of this family, we come to
  consider the first section of the Old World, or Catarrhine<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Monkeys. These are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page249">{249}</span>distinguished from their New World cousins, described in the previous
  pages, by many important and obvious characters. The partition dividing the nostrils is narrow,
  instead of broad, and the openings of the nostrils themselves are directed downwards and outwards.
  Certain genera possess also sacs formed by distensible folds of the skin in the cheeks. These
  "cheek-pouches" serve as a storing-place by the side of the jaws, for food which they cannot
  masticate at the moment. When this store is disposed of, the folds of skin come together again and
  give no indication of the presence of the pouch, which, moreover, when full does not interfere
  with the mastication of other food in the mouth, or with the utterance of the animal's usual
  cries.</p>

  <p>The hind-limbs are never shorter than the fore-; they may be equal in length, but they are
  generally somewhat longer, the animal being more or less quadrupedal, or very partially erect in
  gait. Their thumb is not invariably present, but when it is, it is always opposable to its fellow
  digits. The great-toe is never rudimentary, and is never, as it is in Man, the longest, but is the
  shortest digit of the foot, and it is capable of free motion to and from the others. All of the
  digits possess nails. The length of the foot among this group approximates more to the proportions
  of the foot in Man. The hairs on the arms and fore-arms are directed downwards from the shoulder
  to the wrist.</p>

  <p>The tail in this family varies very much; it may be long or short, or even externally absent,
  but it is never prehensile. All the species, however, possess "callosities," or hard fleshy
  pads&mdash;often of large size&mdash;on the buttocks or seat, which, like the naked skin of the
  face, are usually brilliantly coloured and often of large size. The perineal region and organs are
  at certain periods, especially in the females, subject to great turgescence and brilliant
  coloration.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page250">{250}</span></div>

  <p>Besides these external characters, we find, on examining their bony structure, much variation
  in the skull. Some have a rounded forehead, the ascending portion of the lower jaw being high,
  broad, and flat, with a large facial angle; in others, we have great production of the upper jaw
  (the horizontal part of the lower jaw being greater than the ascending portion), and a low facial
  angle. The cerebral portion of the skull is long and flattened, and the palate long and narrow.
  The dental formula is I<span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span

  <i>pre-molars</i>) <span class="ifrac"><span class="ifracn">2</span><span
  class="ifracd">2</span></span> = 20, exactly the same as in a Man. The outer lower incisors are
  equal to, or sometimes smaller than, the inner pair. The permanent canines&mdash;which are long
  and sharp&mdash;come in before, or with the posterior molars of both jaws. Between them and the
  incisors above, and between the canine and the anterior pre-molar below, occurs a gap (or
  diastema). The anterior upper pre-molar has its outer cusp modified and sharpened; the anterior
  lower pre-molar has the anterior margin of its crown so shaped as to work "as a scissors'-blade
  against the posterior edge of the upper canines." (<i>Henley.</i>) The crowns of the molar teeth
  are long from before backwards, and their fore and hind cusps are united by transverse ridges, a
  third being present in the same genera, on the posterior lower five-cusped molar.</p>

  <p>The nasal bones are often ossified together to form one bone. The surface of the skull is in
  general oval and smooth, but in some of the Baboons there appear strong ridges over the eyes
  (hiding the forehead) and along the top of the head, being stronger, when present, in the male
  than in the female. The external orifice to the ear has a considerable bony tube, or meatus, a
  distinguishing character which is absent in the New <span class="pagenum"
  id="page251">{251}</span>World Monkeys; their tympanic (or ear) cavity being close to the outer
  wall of the skull. The line of junction (or suture) between the upper jaw-bones, the pre-maxillary
  and the maxillary, remains unclosed until long after the permanent teeth have come in. Sometimes
  it remains unclosed throughout life. The foramen for the passage of the spinal-cord, and the
  condyles for the articulation of the skull with the neck, lie far back.</p>

  <p>In the spinal column there are nineteen dorsal and lumbar vertebræ together. The number of
  caudal vertebræ varies greatly; in some there are as many as thirty-one, in others only three. The
  posterior ends of the ischiatic bones of the pelvis are rough, flattened, and broad, for the
  attachment of the fleshy callosities mentioned above.</p>

  <p>The bones of the thigh and leg (<i>femur</i> and <i>tibia</i>) together, are longer than those
  of the arm and fore-arm (<i>humerus</i> and <i>radius</i>) together. The bones of the thumb are
  modified more for support and progression than for the actions of a true hand; by these
  modifications the movements of rotation (pronation and supination) are much restricted.</p>

  <p>The ankle (<i>tarsus</i>) does not exceed one third of the length of the foot.</p>

  <p>The stomach is simple, or but very slightly sacculated, in those genera which possess
  cheek-pouches; but is tripartite&mdash;the middle compartment being sacculated&mdash;in those that
  have not store-pockets in their mouths, "a groove with raised edges leading from the
  gullet-entrance to this middle compartment." The intestine has a cæcum, or blind diverticulum.
  "When laryngeal air-sacs are developed, they are formed by a single sac, with a median
  aperture&mdash;immediately beneath the epiglottis. This median air-sac is very large, extending
  down <span class="pagenum" id="page252">{252}</span>over the front of the neck, and sending [in
  some genera] processes into the <i>axillæ</i>" or arm-pits. (<i>Huxley.</i>)</p>

  <p>The main brain (or cerebrum) covers the cerebellum in all the members of the
  <i>Cercopithecidæ</i>; and in them the principal convolutions and fissures found in the human
  brain are more or less developed.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The family <i>Cercopithecidæ</i> includes all the Old World Monkeys except the
  Anthropoid or true Apes, and Man, these latter constituting the two remaining families of the
  <i>Anthropoidea</i>, namely <i>Simiidæ</i> and <i>Hominidæ</i>. The <i>Cercopithecidæ</i> have
  been again divided into two Sub-families, the <i>Cercopithecinæ</i> and the <i>Semnopithecinæ</i>.
  The first contains the Baboons (<i>Cynocephalus</i>), the Gelada Baboons (<i>Theropithecus</i>),
  the Mangabeys (<i>Cercocebus</i>) and the Guenons (<i>Cercopithecus</i>), all of which inhabit the
  African continent; and likewise the Black Apes (<i>Cynopithecus</i>) from Celebes, and the
  Macaques (<i>Macacus</i>), which are almost exclusively confined to the Asiatic continent. In the
  second Sub-family are included the Nosed-Monkeys (<i>Nasalis</i>) of Borneo; the Langurs
  (<i>Semnopithecus</i>) of India, Malaizia, and the Sunda Islands; and the Guerezas
  (<i>Colobus</i>) of Africa.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:0.8ex;">THE BABOONS, MANGABEYS, AND MACAQUES. SUB-FAMILY
  CERCOPITHECINÆ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This Sub-family is characterised by the presence, in all its members, of
  cheek-pouches, and a simple stomach. The tail is variable in length, being long or externally
  invisible. The callosities on the ischiatic bones are large; in many species they become very
  turgescent at certain seasons, the enlargement extending sometimes to the tail. The hues of the
  skin on and round the face also become more vivid periodically. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page253">{253}</span>Many of the species of this Sub-family are arboreal; some, however, are
  found only in barren rocky regions; others in low jungle in the neighbourhood of villages,
  water-tanks, and cultivated patches. Fruits and insects form their principal diet.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE BABOONS. GENUS

  </div>

  <p>The members of this genus may easily be recognised by their very Dog-like face, their muzzle
  being greatly elongated and truncated at the end, with the nostrils set in the truncated
  termination. Their eyes are directed downwards along the visage. In form and massiveness of body
  and in length of tail they vary very much. Their fore- and hind-limbs are nearly equal in length,
  and consequently they progress on all fours, with the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet
  flat to the ground. Their "fore-paws" are, however, very efficient <i>hands</i>, which some
  species use very dexterously in turning over stones in their search for food. Their feet are long.
  Their hair is grizzled or ringed with various colours.</p>

  <p>The facial region of the skull is more developed in this genus relatively to the flattened
  brain-case, than in other Monkeys. In several of the species longitudinal osseous ridges are
  developed on the bones of the upper jaws, especially in the adult males, adding to the hideousness
  of the countenance of these animals. The neck is elongated. The <i>radius</i> is longer than the
  <i>humerus</i> (or arm-bone), and the elbow projection of the <i>ulna</i> (of the fore-arm), named
  the <i>olecranon</i> process, is prolonged upwards beyond what occurs in Man. The thumb, though
  relatively shorter than in Man, is much <span class="pagenum" id="page254">{254}</span>longer
  proportionately than in other Monkeys, reaching to the middle of the first joint of the
  forefinger.</p>

  <p>Both halves of the liver are much sub-divided.</p>

  <p>Gestation lasts seven months, and the young are suckled for six months.</p>

  <p>The Baboons are the lowest of the Catarrhine or Old World Monkeys. Most of them are large,
  ferocious, dangerous, and gregarious animals, and when disturbed or alarmed they give utterance to
  screams, barks, and guttural murmurs.</p>

  <p>Both Dr. Emil Holub and Sir Richard Burton have spoken of the ferocity of the Baboons. "The
  South African farmers," says the first-named naturalist, "complain of these animals as a great and
  perpetual nuisance." They were always on the look-out, and no sooner was a field or a garden left
  unguarded than they would be down at once, breaking through the hedges and devouring the crops.
  They were likewise very destructive amongst the Sheep. If a shepherd happened to leave his post
  for ever so short a time, or even to fall asleep, the Baboons, who had been watching their chance
  from the heights, would be down upon the flock in the valley, and, seizing the Lambs and ripping
  up their stomachs with their teeth, would feast upon the milk they contained, then leaving the
  poor mangled victim writhing on the ground. Then they would lose no time in repeating the terrible
  operation upon another. "About the middle of the morning," says Dr. Holub, "we started eastwards
  in the hope of catching the herd at their drinking-place.... When we had advanced some distance
  along the hill we found ourselves approaching the pool ... and could distinctly hear the hoarse
  barking of the Baboons. Looking across to the opposite side, about 300 yards away, we caught sight
  of a herd of seven, only four of them full-grown; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255">{255}</span>they seemed to pause and scan us carefully before they decamped to a glen
  on the right. With all speed we followed them.... As one of our party had only small shot, and the
  other nothing but a stick, I insisted upon their remaining close at my side, knowing that a
  full-grown Baboon, when infuriated, is as dangerous a foe as a Leopard.... Behind one of the
  embankments we took our position. Only a few minutes had elapsed when we could distinctly
  recognise them as a herd of Baboons. The boy said he was quite sure that they were on their way to
  the water; but to our surprise they did not make any further advance. A quarter of an hour
  passed&mdash;half an hour&mdash;still no symptom of their approach. All at once, as if they had
  started from the earth by magic, at the open end of the pond, not sixty yards from our place of
  ambush, stood two huge males.... Being anxious to watch the movements of the animals I refrained
  from firing, and determined to see what would follow next. Both Baboons sprang towards the water,
  and leaning down, drank till they were satisfied; then, having gravely stretched themselves, they
  stalked away solemnly on all fours in the direction of the herd. There was little doubt,
  therefore, that they had been sent forward to reconnoitre; for as soon as they got back, the
  entire herd put itself in motion, and made its way towards the pond. There were mothers taking
  care of their little ones; there were the half-grown animals, the boys and girls of the company;
  but there did not seem to be more than three or four full-grown males. At first only one Baboon at
  a time came to the water's edge, and having taken its draught retired to the rest; but when about
  ten of them had thus ventured separately, they began to come in small groups, leaving the others
  rolling and jumping on the sand.... It was not <span class="pagenum" id="page256">{256}</span>long
  before two males&mdash;the same, I had no doubt, which we had noticed before&mdash;came and
  squatted themselves one on each side of the little creek.... Crack went my rifle. But instead of
  either of them dropping, the two Baboons started up; by a mutual instinct they both clutched their
  noses, gave a ringing bark and scampered off. The whole herd took the alarm, and joining in the
  shrieking clamour were soon lost to sight."</p>

  <p>On another occasion Dr. Holub and his servant had a <i>rencontre</i> with a herd of Baboons. He
  writes:&mdash;"We caught sight of them in one of the glens. They were on the further side, and
  being anxious to obtain a specimen of their skulls, I fired and killed one Baboon; but
  unfortunately for me, the creature fell into the river. At my second shot I wounded two more. This
  induced the right wing of the herd to retreat; but the main body kept their ground, and the left
  flank, moreover, assumed the aggressive, and commenced pelting us so vigorously with stones, that,
  remembering that I had only one cartridge, I considered it far more prudent to withdraw than to
  run the risk of a hand-to-hand encounter." On a still further occasion the same well-known
  traveller says: "I was turning to leave the ravine when some stones came pattering down the rocks
  in my direction. I soon became aware that the stones were being designedly aimed at me; and,
  looking up, I saw a herd of Baboons."</p>

  <p>"The Nyanyi or Cynocephalus," writes Sir Richard Burton in his "Lake Regions of Central
  Africa," "in the jungles of Usukuma attains the size of a Greyhound, and, according to the
  natives, there are three varieties of colour&mdash;red, black and yellow. They are the terror of
  the neighbouring districts; women never dare to approach their haunts; they set the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page257">{257}</span>Leopard at defiance, and when in a large body, they do
  not, it is said, fear the Lion."</p>

  <p>"Baboons often show their passion," as Mr. Darwin has related, "and threaten their enemies in a
  very odd manner, namely, by opening their mouths widely, as in the act of yawning. Mr. Bartlett
  has often seen two Baboons, when first placed in the same compartment, sitting opposite to each
  other, and then alternately opening their mouths; and this action seems frequently to end in a
  real yawn. Mr. Bartlett believes that both animals wish to show to each other that they are
  provided with a formidable set of teeth, as is undoubtedly the case. As I could hardly credit the
  reality of this yawning gesture, Mr. Bartlett insulted an old Baboon and put him into a violent
  passion; and he almost immediately thus acted.... Baboons likewise show their anger, as was
  observed by Brehm with those which he kept alive in Abyssinia, in another manner, namely, by
  striking the ground with one hand, 'like an angry man striking the table with his fist.' I have
  seen this movement with the Baboons in the Zoological Gardens; but sometimes the action seems
  rather to represent the searching for a stone or other object in their beds of straw.... With
  several species of Baboons, the ridge of the forehead projects much over the eyes, and is studded
  with a few long hairs, representing our eyebrows. These animals are always looking about them, and
  in order to look upwards they raise their eyebrows. They have thus, as it would appear, acquired
  the habit of frequently moving the latter. However this may be, many kinds of Monkeys, especially
  the Baboons, when angered, or in any way excited, rapidly and incessantly move their eyebrows up
  and down, as well as the hairy skin of their foreheads."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page258">{258}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Baboons are confined to the African continent and to Arabia, to the region, indeed,
  termed Ethiopian, as defined by Sclater and Wallace. They live chiefly on the ground, especially
  in rocky and barren hills, and less frequently among trees, for which their equally long front and
  hind limbs are not so well adapted. Mr. H. H. Johnson, C.B., now H.M. Commissioner in Nyasa-land,
  found, however, on his Kilimanjaro Expedition, that Baboons were singularly abundant in the big
  trees at Taveita, on the rise to that mountain. Their food consists of fruits and Lizards, but
  principally of insects, which they search for under stones, turning these over with their hands.
  They are, indeed, nearly omnivorous, as the reader will have gathered from Dr. Holub's
  observations.</p>

  carried erect, very short, two inches long, and naked beneath; limbs short and powerful; the
  Dog-like nose shorter than the upper lip; nostrils large. Hair rising from the ridge on the lower
  edge of the brow to a crest on the top of the head, descending into a mane on the back of the head
  and neck; hair of the body bristly; chin bearded; whiskers proceeding from over the cheek-bones
  and from under the outer corner of the eyes, long, and directed from the face; the very large
  callosities, parts of the rump in their neighbourhood, and the inside of the thighs naked. Hands
  and feet naked.</p>

  <p>Skull very massive, having numerous strong muscular crests; the jaws and teeth very powerful,
  especially the canines, which are huge; the forehead flat and the brain-case small, and further
  reduced by the great projection backward of the orbits. The cheek-bones enormously swollen along
  the side of the nose; in the neck a large air-sac. The back-bone has to some extent the peculiar
  double curve characteristic of the human vertebral column  but in the conformation of certain of
  their vertebræ a similarity to the lower quadrupeds, especially to the Carnivora, is seen in the
  Mandrill, in accordance with their quadrupedal mode of progression. The metacarpal bones, except
  that of the thumb, are all of the same length, while in the Man-like Apes they are unequal. The
  thumb is much restricted in its motions on account of the disposition of certain of the muscles of
  the hand. The pectoral and pelvic muscles are strongly developed.</p>

  <p>Face-ridges bright blue, with purple in the intervening furrows. The bridge of the nose (after

  adult, they are very savage. They are nearly omnivorous, but fruits and insects form their chief
  food. When the Mandrill is in any way excited, the brilliantly-coloured naked parts of the skin
  are said to become still more vividly coloured.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Somewhat similar to <i>C. maimon</i>, but body less robust, the limbs
  more slender. Face-swellings with only two furrows; crest and mane less prominent; whiskers
  encroaching on the face less than in the Mandrill; beard slightly shorter; ears naked, pointed;
  tail very short, erect, covered with hair all round; the hair round the head, shoulders and sides
  of body, in a band below the chin, on the under surface of the body, and the outer surface of the
  limbs, long and fine; muzzle long and truncated, the nostrils placed at its extremity, and
  somewhat tubular; fingers and toes naked.</p>

  <p>Face entirely black, without bright coloration; general colour of fur brown, approaching that
  of the Mandrill, but washed with greenish on the upper parts, and the shoulders darker. The hairs
  on the top of the head, on the back, and wherever the greenish colour appears, are grey at the
  base, alternating with black and yellow, thus producing the greenish coloration; a band from the
  throat to behind the ear greyish; the whole of the under surface and inner side of the limbs
  greyish-white; beard and whiskers greyish-white, washed with greenish; hands and feet
  reddish-purple; callosities bright scarlet.</p>

  <p><b>Young Male.</b>&mdash;Smaller; face-swellings less marked; fur and beard more washed with
  greenish; neck-band paler grey; whiskers paler; callosities not scarlet.</p>

  <p><b>Female.</b>&mdash;Like the young male, but the head shorter, and the callosities scarlet;
  the head and shoulders less haired; the grey neck-band absent; fur in general paler; the greenish
  hue less marked except on the head and limbs; the fur predominating on the lower part of the back
  and flanks.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This very rare Baboon, of which only a very few specimens are
  known, was brought by Schimper from Central Abyssinia. He states, according to Dr. Slack, that
  these animals are gregarious, as he met with them in troops of from one to two thousand
  individuals. They hunt their prey, which consists mainly of small Ruminants, in a manner similar
  to that of a pack of Hounds, following the quarry till it is exhausted by fatigue, and then
  capturing and devouring it. It <span class="pagenum" id="page263">{263}</span>is also stated that
  the Lion and the Leopard are unknown in the region inhabited by this Baboon. A glance at the
  animal under consideration would convince anyone that it is of a most ferocious disposition. Mr.
  Schimper also informs us that it wages continual war against the Gelada Baboon (<i>Theropithecus
  gelada</i>) which inhabits the same locality.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Face and ears naked; muzzle protruding, the nose extending beyond the
  upper lip; the hair of the body long and shaggy, lengthening on the shoulders and the neck, but
  not forming a conspicuous mane; whiskers small and directed backwards; tail slightly exceeding
  half the length of the body, elevated at its base, and then descending perpendicularly;
  callosities small; hands and feet naked. Sense of smell acute.</p>

  <p>Skull flattened, the cranial portion smaller than the facial; ridges above and at the sides of
  the close-set orbits very large; nasal bones long and prominent; canine teeth very large and
  triangular.</p>

  <p>General colour dark brown or nearly black, washed with green, especially on the forehead, the
  hairs being grey at the base, then ringed alternately with black and green; some of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page264">{264}</span>them, however, lighter. Head, arms, and legs black; face,
  hands, feet, and ears dark blue; a white ring encircling each eye; upper eyelids white; whiskers
  grey.</p>

  <p><b>Female and Young Male.</b>&mdash;Similar to the adult male in wanting a conspicuous mane;
  head rounder; nose less protuberant; cranial portion of skull less conspicuously disproportionate
  to the facial portion.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species inhabits South Africa; and in the Cape Colony it is
  found in large troops.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Chacma, which is the largest of all the Baboons, lives,
  like the others, in troops, consisting of nearly a hundred individuals. They inhabit rocky places,
  and apparently prefer country broken into steep cliffs and rocky crags, very often in the
  neighbourhood of the sea. The Chacmas are very ferocious and dangerous, and in captivity, when
  fully adult, extremely jealous, but when young they are said to be playful and well-dispositioned.
  They are, moreover, very intelligent. Their sense of smell, especially for hidden water-springs in
  dry and arid districts, is said to be remarkable. "An animal," says Le Vaillant, in his "Travels
  in Africa," "that rendered me more effectual services; which, by its useful presence, suspended
  and even dissipated certain bitter and disagreeable reflections that occurred to my mind; which,
  by its simple and striking instinct, seemed to anticipate my efforts; and which comforted me in my
  languor&mdash;was an Ape, of that kind so common at the Cape, under the name of <i>Cawiars</i>. As
  it was extremely familiar, and attached itself to me in a particular manner, I made it my taster.
  When we found any fruit or roots unknown to my Hottentots, we never touched them until my dear
  Kees [the Chacma] had first tasted them; if it refused them, we <span class="pagenum"
  id="page265">{265}</span>judged them to be either disagreeable or dangerous, and threw them away."
  The food of the "Chacma," an Anglicised form of the Hottentot name for this Baboon, consists of
  Lizards, Scorpions, Centipedes, and all manner of insects; birds' eggs, gum, and honey are
  particularly relished by it. When these are difficult to find, it searches for the bulbous roots
  of certain liliaceous plants, of which it is very fond, and which it very ingeniously disinters.
  As Le Vaillant has recorded of the same individual to which we have just referred: "He laid hold
  of the tuft of leaves with his teeth, and pressing his four paws firmly against the earth, and
  drawing his head backwards, the root generally followed; when this method did not succeed, he
  seized the tuft as before, as close to the earth as he could, then throwing his heels over his
  head, the root always yielded to the jerk he gave it."</p>

  nostrils large, round, separated by a longitudinal furrow above; tail shorter than the body,
  haired throughout its <span class="pagenum" id="page266">{266}</span>length; curved upwards at the
  root, and then descending straightly; no mane; hair of crown elongated, a large tuft directed
  backwards on each cheek, forming large whiskers.</p>

  <p>General colour of fur brownish-yellow; ears nude, coloured like the face; face livid
  flesh-colour, deeper round the eyes; upper side of body uniform brownish-yellow, the hairs being
  ringed alternately with broader yellow and narrower black bars; sides of body somewhat darker;
  throat and under side paler yellow than above; whisker-tufts pale citron-yellow; hands and feet
  like the back in colour, their naked parts like the face.</p>

  <p><b>Young Male.</b>&mdash;Coloration of upper parts similar to that of the adult male, but paler
  underneath; the snout less protuberant.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species inhabits Western Abyssinia, Nubia (Dongola), and the
  Soudan (Sennaar), at elevations of from 2,000 to 5,000 feet. It also occurs on the West Coast of
  Africa&mdash;having been brought from the Coanza river by the late Captain Cameron, R.N.; in East
  Africa Mr. H. H. Johnston has observed it on Mount Kilimanjaro; while from the remarks of Sir John
  Kirk given below it would seem to extend also as far south as the Zambesi (Tete).</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Very little is known of the habits of the Baboons in a state
  of nature; but it is probable that this species does not differ materially in its ways and manners
  of life from those of its near relations described in the preceding pages. Sir John Kirk says that
  in some parts of Africa, such as Tete, Batoko, and Rovuma it is considered to be a sacred animal
  by the natives, and is thus unmolested.</p>

  black and yellow; arms and legs like the back; the naked hands and feet flesh-colour.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Interior of West Africa. Lagos, in the Bight of Benin, is the port
  from which this species is generally shipped to Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Anubis Baboon is not a common species in captivity, as the natives are
  terribly afraid of its strength and ferocity. The animals wander about in companies, inhabiting
  chiefly the dry, rocky, mountainous regions in the interior of West Africa, feeding on the
  peculiar vegetation that they find there; digging up the roots of grasses, and gnawing with their
  strong jaws the roots and stems of an extraordinary short, woody, top-shaped plant, known as
  <i>Welwitschia</i>, which produces in its youth two leaves, and never more in its lifetime, though
  attaining to a great age. They feed also on the <i>Scytonema</i>, a moisture-storing plant, which
  grows only on rocks. Though affecting dry, rocky regions from choice, the Anubis Baboons often
  descend in large hordes to the cultivated country, and ravage the gardens of the natives.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. Darwin, in describing the expression of pleasure, joy, and affection in
  Monkeys, observed that, when they were pleased, the form of the lips differed a little from that
  when they were angered. In the case of an Anubis Baboon which was first <span class="pagenum"
  id="page268">{268}</span>insulted and put into a furious rage by his keeper, who afterwards made
  friends with him, Mr. Darwin relates that, "as the reconciliation was effected, the Baboon rapidly
  moved up and down his jaws and lips, and looked pleased. When we laugh heartily, a similar
  movement or quiver may be observed more or less distinctly in our jaws; but with Man the muscles
  of the chest are more particularly acted on; whilst with this Baboon, and with some other Monkeys,
  it is the muscles of the jaws and lips which are spasmodically affected."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The Guinea Baboon inhabits West Africa from Senegal and the Niger to
  Central Africa. In East Africa, Mr. H. H. Johnston observed it in the inhabited region of

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;Little is known of the habits of this species; but it is
  improbable that it departs widely from those of the other <span class="pagenum"
  id="page271">{271}</span>members of the genus. In regard to the bright coloration of the
  callosities and posterior parts of this and other Baboons, Mr. Darwin remarks: "In the discussion
  on sexual selection in my 'Descent of Man,' no case interested and perplexed me so much as the
  highly-coloured hinder ends and adjoining parts of certain Monkeys. As these parts are more
  brightly coloured in one sex than the other, and as they become more brilliant during the season
  of love, I concluded that the colours had been gained as a sexual attraction.... I had, however,
  at that time no evidence of Monkeys exhibiting this part of their bodies during their
  courtship.... I have lately read [in an article by J. von Fischer, of Gotha, published in April,
  1876] an account of the behaviour of a young male Mandrill when he first beheld himself in a
  looking-glass, and it is added, that after a time he turned round and presented his red hinder end
  to the glass. Accordingly I wrote to Herr J. von Fischer to ask what he supposed was the meaning
  of this strange action. He says that he was himself at first perplexed ... and was thus led
  carefully to observe several individuals of various other species of Monkeys, which he has long
  kept in his house. He finds that not only the Mandrill (<i>C. mormon</i>) but the Drill (<i>C.
  leucophæus</i>) and three other kinds of Baboons (<i>C. hamadryas</i>, <i>C. sphinx</i>, and <i>C.
  babuin</i>) ... turn this part of their bodies, which in all these species is more or less
  brightly coloured, to him when they are pleased, and to other persons as a sort of greeting....
  From these facts von Fischer concludes that the Monkeys which behaved in this manner before a
  looking-glass ... acted as if their reflection were a new acquaintance.... It deserves especial
  attention that von Fischer has never seen any species purposely exhibit the hinder part of its
  body, if not at all <span class="pagenum" id="page272">{272}</span>coloured.... With respect to
  the origin of the habit, it seems to me probable that the bright colours, whether on the face or
  hinder end, or as in the Mandrill, on both, serve as a sexual ornament and attraction.... The fact
  that it is only the Monkeys (with those parts brightly coloured), which as far as at present
  known, act in this manner as a greeting towards other Monkeys, renders it doubtful whether the
  habit was first acquired from some independent cause, and that afterwards the parts in question
  were coloured as a sexual ornament; or whether the colouring and the habit of turning round were
  first acquired through variation and sexual selection, and that afterwards the habit was retained
  as a sign of pleasure, or as a greeting, through the principle of inherited association."</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Arabia, from the plains up to 9,000 feet; Abyssinia, and the
  Soudan.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The Arabian Baboon, or "Tartarin," as it is often called, is gregarious
  like its allies, occurring in troops of from two hundred and fifty to three hundred individuals.
  When full-grown, they are very bold and ferocious. They feed on fruits, berries, and the tubers of
  an edible grass; but their chief food consists of insects, and such small animals as they find
  under stones, or among the rocky cliffs and ravines, where they usually dwell, for they seem to
  avoid the wooded country.</p>

  <p>They have a loud voice, uttered as a grunting bark. They are said to be extremely intelligent,
  "astonishingly clever fellows," as one traveller records:&mdash;having chiefs whom they obey
  implicitly, and possessing a regular system of tactics in war, with the posting of sentinels on
  pillaging expeditions. They have variously modulated cries, to warn, to indicate safety or false
  alarm, or to direct the general movements or conduct of the troop. "The old males," as Mr.
  Blanford narrates, "are always most conspicuous animals, all the fore part of their body being
  covered with long hair. They usually take the lead when the troop is moving; some of them also
  bringing up the rear; others placing themselves on high rocks or bushes and keeping a sharp
  look-out after enemies. A troop collected on a rocky crag presents a most singular appearance. I
  several times saw large numbers assembled around springs in the evening in the thirsty Shoho
  country.... On such occasions every jutting rock, every little stone more prominent than the rest,
  was occupied by a patriarch of the herd, with the gravity and watchfulness befitting his grizzled
  hair, waiting patiently until the last of his human rivals had slaked his thirst and that of his
  cattle. Around, the females were mainly occupied in taking <span class="pagenum"
  id="page275">{275}</span>care of the young, the smaller Monkeys amusing themselves by gambolling
  about." The Arabian Baboon climbs heavily, but when moving quickly on the ground has a regular
  steady gallop.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This is the Sacred Monkey of the ancient Egyptians, and its likeness is often found
  engraved on their various temples and monoliths. "The Cynocephalus Ape," as Sir Gardner Wilkinson
  writes, "which was particularly sacred to Thoth, held a conspicuous place among the sacred animals
  of Egypt, being worshipped as the type of the God of Letters, and of the Moon, which was one of
  the characters of Thoth.... Sometimes a Cynocephalus placed on a throne as a god, holds a sacred
  Ibis in his hand; and in the judgment-scenes of the dead it frequently occurs, seated on the
  summit of a balance, as the emblem of Thoth, who had an important office on that occasion, and
  registered the account of the actions of the deceased. The place where this animal was
  particularly sacred was Hermopolis, the city of Thoth. In the necropolis of the capital of Upper
  Egypt, a particular spot was set apart as the cemetery of the Sacred Apes."</p>

  elevated at <span class="pagenum" id="page277">{277}</span>the tip upon the deep upper lip; head
  crested, with long hair, rising from the superciliary ridge, and descending to a long and
  mantle-like mane on the back of the neck and shoulders, where the hair is longest, down to the

  and one on the throat naked, separated from each other by a haired bar 1½ inches broad; tail long,
  round, erect for its basal third, then falling straight down as in other Baboons, and terminating
  in a long thick tuft.</p>

  <p>Face, hands, feet and callosities deep black; nude chest-spaces florid; hair of whiskers,
  neck-portion of mane, sides, arms, and lower margins of the mantle-like mane dark sooty
  chocolate-brown; breast, chest, shoulders, fore-arms, hind quarters and tail (except the terminal

  <p class="sp3"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;The habits of the "Gelada," as it is named by the natives of
  its own country, are similar to those of the Baboons (<i>Cynocephalus</i>). They live in large
  companies, and when full-grown&mdash;the males especially&mdash;are very ferocious, pugnacious,
  and dangerous. It is a common habit of these animals to roll down stones from the rocky cliffs
  amid which they live, upon any approaching animal&mdash;the Arabian Baboon being an especial
  object of their animosity. Their food consists of all sorts of fruits, as well as grass, and the
  cultivated crops of the natives. They are chiefly found in barren rocky regions, ascending the
  mountains to an altitude of from 7,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;Nearly allied to <i>T. gelada</i>, but distinguished by its darker

  thick. Length of body, 53 inches; tail, 26 inches.</p>

  <p>Face black, but with a broad flesh-coloured ring round each eye; scanty hairs on the chin
  white; top of head and back dark brown; mane on fore-neck and shoulders, arms, and hind part of

  dark flesh-coloured, more vivid in passion; breast and inner side of fore-arm, and middle of chest
  white; rest of under surface pale brown. Callosities bluish-grey.</p>

  <p><b>Female and Young.</b>&mdash;Almost uniform fulvous, but the mane less marked.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;North-east Africa; on the eastern boundary of Abyssinia, near the
  sources of the Takazze river, on the confines of the Galla country. Dr. Blanford observed it also
  near Magdala.</p>

  <p><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This large and "stately" Baboon, known to the natives as "Tokur-Sinjero"
  (or Black Baboon), lives in large troops in the high mountains of Abyssinia, at an altitude of
  from 6,000 to 10,000 feet. It is seldom seen among trees, but generally in open plains, or in
  inaccessible rocky cliffs, from which it hurls stones on anyone who dares to approach. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page280">{280}</span>During the night these Baboons hide together in holes in
  the rocks, whence, on the return of the morning sun, they emerge and sit warming themselves,
  before starting on their marauding expeditions in the cultivated fields, or in the vegetation
  which clothes the sides of the deep valleys, where they feed largely on the leaves of the trees.
  Their disposition is, among themselves, harmless. As a rule two to six year old males lead with
  grave strides a herd of twenty to thirty females and young, the latter now playing with each
  other, and scampering about the troop, now carried by their mothers, and sometimes pinched and
  boxed on the ears by them. As soon as, but not before, the leader has assured himself of any
  danger, he utters a gentle bark, to which the whole troop responds and retreats back into safety
  among the rocks. The old males then stand on their hind-feet barking and displaying to the
  intruder their long white teeth. On their marauding expeditions, or when in flight, they do not
  usually exhibit great haste, the whole troop generally going in single file with an old Sultan
  bringing up the rear. Often several troops mingle together during the day, but at nightfall each
  returns to its own headquarters.</p>

  <p>Their cry is a sharp bark, but that of the old males is very hoarse. One of their great enemies
  is the Lämmergeier or Bearded Vulture.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These observations have been extracted from the account given of this species by
  von Heuglin, who discovered it during his Abyssinian expedition in 1853.</p>

  <p><b>Characters.</b>&mdash;About the size of a Spaniel; head oblong; face very elongated, naked;
  neck, hands, and feet also naked; nose triangular, the sides erect, flattened behind nearly to the
  eyes, not extending to the end of the muzzle, but leaving a broad upper lip; nostrils, with a long
  and broad partition between them, directed downwards and outwards&mdash;a character seen in the
  genus <i>Macacus</i>, and distinguishing this genus from the true Baboons (<i>Cynocephalus</i>);
  cheek-swellings parallel to the nose, distinct, but not conspicuously large; supra-orbital ridges
  very conspicuous; cheek-pouches large; tail rudimentary, reduced to a fleshy tubercle, one inch
  long, and hardly visible. Length, 24 inches.</p>

  <p>Fur long and woolly over the body; especially long on the top of the head, forming a crest;
  hair of the limbs shorter.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page282">{282}</span></div>

  <p>Face, neck, hands, and feet black; fur all over the body and limbs jet-black; callosities
  bright flesh-colour.</p>

  <p>In the skull the maxillary bones are developed into strong lateral ridges corresponding in
  structure to those of the most typical Baboons.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species is found far away from the habitat of the true Baboons,
  whose home is in the Ethiopian Region. The Black Baboon is an inhabitant of Celebes, one of the
  islands of the eastern portion of the Malay Archipelago. It is found, however, also in the
  neighbouring island of Batchian, further to the east&mdash;indeed the most easterly range of the
  Quadrumana&mdash;as well as in some of the Philippine Islands to the west. In both of these
  regions it is supposed to have been accidentally introduced by the Malays. In Batchian, Mr.
  Wallace remarks, "it seems so much out of place that it is difficult to imagine how it could have
  reached the island by any natural means of dispersal, and yet not have passed by the same means
  over the narrow strait to Gilolo&mdash;so that it seems more likely to have originated from some
  individuals which had escaped from confinement, these and similar animals being often kept as pets
  by the Malays and carried about in their praus." Analogous to the distribution of this animal in
  the Philippines and Celebes is that of a genus of Parrots&mdash;<i>Prioniturus</i>&mdash;with
  racquet-shaped tails. The species of the latter genus are divided between Celebes and its small
  adjacent islands and the Philippines and the small islands adjacent to that archipelago, and
  present a curious case of the restricted range of a well-marked group.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>Habits.</b>&mdash;This interesting animal, geographically so isolated, lives in
  the luxuriant forests in small companies, and feeds chiefly on the abundant fruits which these
  forests provide. In its <span class="pagenum" id="page283">{283}</span>disposition it appears to
  be more amiable and docile than the African Baboons. Some kinds of Monkeys, as Mr. Darwin
  observes, which have moveable ears, and fight with their teeth, draw back their ears when
  irritated just like Dogs, and then they have a very spiteful appearance.... Other kinds&mdash;and
  this is a great anomaly in comparison with most other animals&mdash;retract their ears, "and utter
  a slight jabbering noise when they are pleased by being caressed. I observed this in the
  <i>Cynopithecus niger</i>.... With the <i>Cynopithecus</i> the corners of the mouth are at the
  same time drawn backwards and upwards, so that the teeth are exposed. Hence this expression would
  never be recognised by a stranger as one of pleasure. The crest of long hairs on the forehead is
  depressed, and apparently the whole skin of the head is drawn backwards. The eyebrows are thus
  raised a little, and the eyes assume a staring appearance. The lower eyelids also become slightly
  wrinkled; but this wrinkling is not conspicuous, owing to the permanent transverse furrows on the
  face." When enraged, the <i>Cynopithecus niger</i> depresses the crest of hair on its forehead,
  and shows its teeth; "so that," as Mr. Darwin continues, "the movements of the features from anger
  are nearly the same as those from pleasure; and the two expressions can be distinguished only by
  those familiar with the animal." See the figures in Mr. Darwin's "Emotions in Man," &amp;c., p.
  136.</p>
